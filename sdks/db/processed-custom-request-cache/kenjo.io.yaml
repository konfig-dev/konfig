  apiDescription: >-
    Before starting to use the Kenjo API, you have to request the API activation
    for a sandbox or production environment to the Kenjo Customer Success team.
    After that, an admin user has to go to *Settings > Integrations > API keys*,
    to generate the **API Key**. Follow the steps described in the
    **Autentication section** of this document. <br>The API key is needed to
    request the bearer token. Each endpoint callout requires a valid bearer
    token in the Authorization header. Once the token is retrieved, it will be
    useful during the time limit indicated by the 'expiration date'.
