  apiDescription: >
    The Notabene API is organized around
    [REST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer).

    Our API accepts [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) request bodies, returns
    [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard [HTTP
    status codes](https://httpstatuses.com/) and verbs.


    All requests to the Notabene API should be made to one of the following root
    URLs:


    * Test: https://api.notabene.dev

    * Live: https://api.notabene.id


    All API requests must be made over HTTPS; calls made over plain HTTP will
    fail. API requests without authentication will also fail - see the
    Authentication section for information on correctly authenticating calls to
    the Notabene API.
