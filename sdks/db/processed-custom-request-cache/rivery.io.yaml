    # Rivery API documentation


    Welcome to the Rivery API Documentation. 


    Using the Rivery API, you can automate any single or group operations you
    perform in the Rivery console. 

    You can create, execute, and delete Rivers, create DataFrames, automate
    processes, and more.

    The Rivery API is structured around REST. It accepts JSON request bodies,
    returns JSON responses,

    and employs conventional HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs to
    access and use data through HTTP requests. 


    Consult our [Legacy API](https://api-docs.rivery.io/) documentation. 


    Please [contact our Support team]( mailto:<contact@rivery.io>) if you have
    any questions or concerns.


    # Authorization

    ## Rivery API Token

    To generate a Bearer token, please check out [Rivery's
    docs](https://docs.rivery.io/docs/rivery-api).


    Every bearer token is a combination of account, environment, and scopes
    attached. Every time the token is provided,

    the API compares its scopes with the request required scope.

    If the scope is not valid, an insufficient permissions (403) response code
    returned.


    ## Scopes

    A scope is defined as a combination of the entity in Rivery, and the
    operation allowed to perform on the entity.


    The entity can be any entity available via the API, for example -
    connection.

    An operation can be one of specific operations allowed for each scope. For
    example: list or edit.

    Therefore, listing connections scope will be set as `connection:list`.

    Please make sure the Bearer token is has the right scopes attached for all
    of the needed requests.
