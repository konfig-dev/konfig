        [Optional] If you provide a secret token when configuring your webhook,
        this will be used to create a digest of the JSON payload sent with each
        webhook request.

        The digest will be included in the request under the `Ashby-Signature`
        http header.


        It will look like this:

        `Ashby-Signature:
        sha256=f3124911d2956f10aa3a49c43a88bdf13bba846e94f0ae2bd7c034f90239bd04`


        The part before the = indicates the algorithm that was used to compute
        the hash digest.
