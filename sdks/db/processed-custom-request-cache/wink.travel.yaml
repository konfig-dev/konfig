        ## Retrieve access token

        Make a POST (`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`) request
        to the Token URL below. Include one POST key/value entry:
        `grant_type=client_credentials` and include your clientID / secretKey
        credentials in a Basic Auth header. E.g. `Authorization: Basic
        base64_encode($clientId + ':' + $secretKey)`.

        ## Add Bearer access token to all API requests

        Once you have the access token, you can pass that along on all API
        requests in the authentication header: `'Authorization: Bearer
        $accessToken`.

        Note: Tokens expire after 3 hours. Please make sure you refresh your
        token before that time.

    ## SDKs

    We are actively working on supporting the most used languages out there. If
    you don't see your language here, reach out to us with a request to
    officially add your language. In the meantime, if you want to roll your own
    SDK, you can do so by downloading the OpenAPI spec and using one of the many
    available OpenAPI generators available:
    [https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators](https://openapi-generator.tech/docs/generators).


    - Java SDK
    [https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java](https://github.com/wink-travel/wink-sdk-java)


    ## Usage

    These features are made available to you via a [REST
    API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). This
    API is language agnostic.


    ## Versioning

    We chose to version our endpoints in a way that we hope affects your
    integration with us the least. You request the version of our API you wish
    to work with via the `Wink-Version` header. When it's time for you to
    upgrade, you only have to change the version number to get access to our
    updated endpoints.

    - 2022-05-08: v1 - Exposed channel manager API
