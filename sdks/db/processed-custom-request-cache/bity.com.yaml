  apiDescription: |
    The present document gives the technical details enabling one to make
    request to and understand the responses of the Exchange API. Should you
    want to know what is possible to do with the API, please consult the
    product guide or have a look at the
    [product page](https://go.bity.com/Exchange API).

    Version 2 of the Exchange API (this version) is stable and should be
    considered reliable. However, Bity reserves itself the right to correct
    bugs in these API endpoints without considering such corrections as being
    breaking changes.

    Connection to the API happens over HTTP/1.1 (RFC 7231) and HTTP State
    Management (RFC 6265) is required. Most libraries and user-agents allowing
    HTTP requests to be performed already implements that for you as long as
    cookies are not disabled and that you are requesting credentials to be
    included in the requests.

    API clients of registered partners add an optional `Client-ID` header to
    the requests. This enables partners to benefit from profit sharing. See the
    [corresponding section of the product guide
    ](https://doc.bity.com/exchange/guide.html#financial-partners)
    for more details.

    End-users can access the order status page via
    [https://go.bity.com/order-status](https://go.bity.com/order-status). A
    link to the status of a specific order can be constructed by appending the
    order identifier to `https://go.bity.com/order-status?id=`. The order
    status page allows to contact the Bity Support Team about a specific order.
