    # Introduction


    Welcome to the Jiko API Reference! Jiko enables you to integrate money
    storage and movement, backed by the safety and security of US Treasury
    Bills.


    </br>


    At the core of our platform is the Jiko account: a pair consisting of a bank
    account and a brokerage account. When money is deposited into an account,
    the funds are automatically invested in T-bills. When a payment or
    withdrawal is made, T-bills are immediately liquidated and used as cash.
    Customers can have multiple accounts, and each account is associated with a
    single T-bill maturity: 4-week, 13-week, 26-week or 52-week.


    </br>


    The API Reference covers everything you need to build a full application
    leveraging the Jiko platform:


    </br>


    - Onboarding customers

    - Funding customer accounts via ACH or Wire

    - Viewing and managing accounts (including monthly statements and trade
    confirmations)

    - Making payments and transfers via ACH, Wire, On-Us (Book) Transfer or
    Debit Card


    </br>


    When you’re ready to start building, please contact us at
    [partner.support@jiko.io](mailto:partner.support@jiko.io) to request sandbox
    access.

    # Partner obligations


    </br>


    - Before onboarding, the end-user’s control over any email addresses or
    phone numbers must be confirmed (for example, via confirmation codes) before
    submitting an application to the API.

    - While onboarding, partners must comply with the disclosure requirements
    listed [below](https://docs.jiko.io/reference).

    - Monthly statements are created for bank and brokerage accounts and must be
    made available to the user.
      - Partners are required to send an email to end users every month a new statement is available to comply with regulatory requirements.
      - Partners can expect monthly statements to be available by the 15th of every month.
      - It is required to make the past 6 years of brokerage statements available to the end user.
      - It is advised to make at least the past 12 months of bank statements available to the end user.
    - Trade confirmations must be made available to the user.


    ## Disclosures and Agreements


    - The bundle of customer disclosures and agreements served at the
    [Agreements](https://docs.jiko.io/reference) endpoint must be presented to
    users before signing up for an account.
      This includes Risk and Limitation disclosures, Regulation E disclosures, Account agreements and more.
      - The customer consent for these disclosures have to be versioned and time-stamped and sent with the application.
    - Jiko reserves the right to update agreements from time to time.
      If a change is _adverse_ to the customer, Jiko will notify partners, and they are then required to notify their end users 30 days in advance of the change.
      - A change is deemed to be _adverse_ to the customer if it will result in increased fees, increased liability for the customer, fewer types of available transactions or stricter limitations on the frequency or dollar amount of transactions.
    - When Jiko updates the bundle of agreements, the version number of the
    agreement bundle will increment.
      Jiko reserves the right to reject or manually review applications where customer consent does not match the latest agreement version.
      Partners must re-fetch and display the agreements and disclosures links from the Agreements endpoint for every new application. This ensures each applicant is served the latest version of the agreements.

    # Authentication


    **Jiko** provides partners with a `username` and a `password`, as well as a
    `shared secret`. Partners are provided with a `bearer token` in the
    [Login](https://docs.jiko.io/reference) response, which must be sent with
    each request.


    </br>


    Each request made to the partner API needs 3 parts in order for it to be
    processed:


    1. An **Authorization** HTTP header containing the value


    ```javascript

    Bearer <access_token>

    ```


    </br>


    Where the `access_token` is the bearer token given in the
    [Login](https://docs.jiko.io/reference) response.


    1. An **x-jiko-idempotency** HTTP header set to a random uuid for this
    action, in order to signify a unique request to the API from the partner’s
    perspective.

    2. An **x-jiko-signature** HTTP header set to a base64 encoded HMAC-SHA256
    hash of `x-jiko-idempotency+request pathname+body` using the shared secret
    as a key.


    Below is a Node.js example showing how a potential request could be signed:


    </br>


    ```javascript

    const crypto = require("crypto");

    const uuid = require("uuid");


    const idempotency = uuid.v4();

    const pathname = "/api/v1/agreements/";

    const body = "";


    request.headers["x-jiko-signature"] = crypto
      .createHmac("sha256", "shared-secret-here")
      .update(idempotency + pathname + body, "utf-8")
      .digest("base64");
    ```


    </br>


    **Partner** requests will need to be sent from an IP address whitelisted by
    **Jiko**.

    **Jiko** will verify the request signature by repeating the steps above,
    additionally checking for possible repeated requests. A request is
    considered to be repeated if the idempotency key value provided in the
    `x-jiko-idempotency` header has been used previously in the past 1 hour.


    </br>


    Bearer tokens have a lifetime of 60 minutes.

    The partner will need to repeat the login process once a token has expired.
