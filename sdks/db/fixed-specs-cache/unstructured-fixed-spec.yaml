    At Unstructured, we're on a mission to give organizations access to all of
    their data. We know the world runs on documentsâ€”from research reports and
    memos, to quarterly filings and plans of action, documents are the unit of
    information that companies depend on. And yet, 80% of this information is
    trapped in inaccessible formats, and businesses have long struggled to
    unlock this data, leading to information silos, inefficient decision-making,
    and repetitive work. Until now.


    Unstructured captures this unstructured data wherever it lives and
    transforms it into AI-friendly JSON files for companies who are eager to
    fold AI into their business.

              A prefix of this many trailing characters from the prior text-split

            title: Unique element IDs
            description: >-
              When True, assign UUIDs to element IDs, which guarantees their
              uniqueness (useful when using them as primary keys in database).
              Otherwise a SHA-256 of element text is used. Default: False
