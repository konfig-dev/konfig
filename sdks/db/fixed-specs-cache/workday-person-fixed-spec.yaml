        Enables you to perform a Home Contact Change task. Using these REST APIs,
        you can get and update home contact information such as address, e-mail
        address, phone number, web address, and instant messenger.


        To start and submit a home contact change request for a specific person: 


        1. Initiate a home contact change event by calling a POST request for a
        role that can use this business process. Example: the POST
        staffing/workers/{ID}/homeContactInformationChanges operation that returns
        a new home contact change ID. 


        2. Update data for the home contact change request by calling operations
        on the available person/homeContactInformationChanges/{id}/{subresource}
        endpoints. These allow you to add, update, or remove home contact
        information.  The correct Usage Type to use when doing so is Home,
        "836cf00ef5974ac08b786079866c946f"


        3. Submit the home contact change request by calling the POST
        person/homeContactInformationChanges/{ID}/submit endpoint. The updated
        data in the preceding home contact change requests don't persist until you
        call POST person/homeContactInformationChanges/{ID}/submit.

        summary: Validates phone number data to ensure it is valid for Workday.

          Validates the specified completePhoneNumber in the request body.

          The completePhoneNumber field is required in the request body.


          If the specified completePhoneNumber is valid, this method returns the
          201 response status. If the specified completePhoneNumber is invalid,
          this method returns the 400 response status with a validation error
          message. 


          This method assumes the Allowed Phone Validations for the country of the
          phone is enabled on the Tenant Setup - Global configuration.

          If the tenant configuration has disabled the Allowed Phone Validations
          for the associated country, the validation returns as valid.

          To save for later, specify this request body:

          The action id value is the Workday ID of the Save for Later action. If
          you submit this endpoint with the Save for Later action, you can no
          longer edit nor resubmit the Work Contact Change event using the REST

          To submit the Home Contact Change event and initiate the Home Contact
          Change business process, specify an empty request body: {}.

          To save for later, specify this request body:

          {
              "businessProcessParameters": {
                  "action":{
                      "id": "d9e41a8c446c11de98360015c5e6daf6"

              }
          }


          The action id value is the Workday ID of the Save for Later action. If
          you submit this endpoint with the Save for Later action, you can no
          longer edit nor resubmit the Home Contact Change event using the REST
          APIs. The user with correct permissions can edit and submit the saved
          Home Contact Change event in the Workday UI.
