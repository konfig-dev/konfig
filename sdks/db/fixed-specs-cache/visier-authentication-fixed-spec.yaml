          The `Status` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for
          different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It
          is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc). Each `Status` message
          contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error
          details. You can find out more about this error model and how to work
          with it in the [API Design
          Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).
