        MeasureOne offers a secure, API-based platform to power
        consumer-permissioned data sharing,  providing a safe and transparent way
        for consumers to share data with third-party applications.


        The MeasureOne platform acts as a bridge between data sources containing
        the consumer's personal data and data recipients.  Data sources are online
        systems that house the data to be shared and that are accessible to the
        consumer.   Example data sources are academic institutions, payroll
        processors, utility providers government systems and others.  Data
        recipients are any third-party that the consumer wishes to share
        information with, often in return for a product or service that the data
        recipient is offering.   Example recipients are lenders, marketeers,
        background check companies, employers,  recruiters, and others.


        The MeasureOne API allows you as a data recipient to integrate
        consumer-permissioned data into your workflows.   It does so by
        facilitating consent, access, acquisition, and delivery of your users'
        permissioned data.    In the basic workflow of consumer-permissioned
        sharing is as follows.   First, your users provide their consent to
        Measure one to share specific personal information with you.  They then
        share their credentials with MeasureOne providing access to data -- called
        "source data" -- that provides the information that they have consented to
        share with you.  MeasureOne uses these credentials to connect that data
        source to its platform, access and acquire the source data.    MeasureOne
        then provides access to this source data through a set of service APIs.   


        There are several benefits to using the MeasureOne API.   Our API hides
        the complexity involved in the consumer-permissioning workflow behind a
        simple straighforward API so that you can focus on your application and
        customer experience.    We handle user credentials so you don't have to. 
        We handle consents from the user and ensure that you only receive access
        to the consented information, freeing you from the need to worry about
        accessing consumer information improperly.   We also provide guarantees to
        your user that we will not share information outside the scope of their
        consent.    This provides you with the opportunity to have your users
        share information with you that otherwise would not be accessible. 
        Finally,  MeasureOne ensures the provenance of the shared data.   The data
        is shared by the user, with their explicit consent, but without any
        ability to modify or tamper with it.


        The current 3.0 version is not backward compatible with version 2.0.   If
        you are a 2.0 user, please see our [Migration
        Guide](https://docs.measureone.com).
    - name: Sample Use cases
      description: >

        This section gives you some brief use cases for using the API in your
        workflow. For complete details, please see the full documentation. 



        ### Income or Employment Verification


        Extracting income information from paystubs, 1099 or other income-related
        documents provides you with a comprehensive solution to assessing your
        user's income.



        ### Home and Auto Insurance Policy Verification or Quoting


        By facilitating the sharing of home and auto insurance policies,
        MeasureOne enables customers to verify insurance information during auto
        and home transactions or provide detailed policy information for
        comparative quoting purposes.



        ### Academic qualification, history or enrollment status assessment


        MeasureOne supports acquisition and processing of academic documents.  By
        connecting the user's academic institution to our platform, MeasureOne
        uses the shared transcripts and other educational data to provide an
        assessment or verification of educational data.  This includes  academic
        history, degree verification, student enrollment status or other similar
        data.   



        ### Identity and Fraud Detection


        By leveraging multiple items of consumer-permissioned data, MeasureOne
        provides unique opportunities to customers to establish identity and
        protect against fraud.



        ### Alternative Data Financial Underwriting

          MeasureOne's MeritScore is a proprietary predictive analytic that correlates credit performance with academic data.    Using consumer-permissioned transcripts, MeasureOne provides a score that correlates the user's academic performance to credit default risk.   This both reduces risk for the lender while opening up new credit opportunities for young borrowers.
    - name: key_concepts
      x-displayName: Core Resources
      description: >

        MeasureOne has four core resources. These resources help you seamlessly
        integrate consumer-permissioned-data workflow into your applications. 


        ### Individual


        The Individual is your end user/consumer whom you are requesting to share
        data or information with you as part of your application.   In a typical
        implementation, ths Individual is directed to MeasureOne through an
        invitation initiated from your application or the MeasureOne Dashboard.  
        MeasureOne then interacts with the Individual to complete the
        consumers-permissioned data sharing workflow and shares the accessed
        Individual data with you, either directly with your application or through
        the MeasureOne Dashboard. 


        ### Data Requests


        A consumer-permissioned data workflow is initiated and defined by the Data
        Request resource.   A Data Request specifies or bind together the various
        elements of a consumer-permissioned data workflow, in particular: the
        Individual, the type of data requested, the reports to be generated, the
        Link experience, optional Individual communication and messaging.   

          The following table specifies the supported Data Request types.   Based on the Data Request type, MeasureOne tailors the consumer-permissioned 
          workflow to satisfy the indicated request for data.   

          | Data Request Type | Description                                             | 
          |-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
          | ACADEMIC_SUMMARY  | Request the education summary of the Individual
          | ENROLLMENT_STATUS | Request the enrollment status of the Individual
          | EMPLOYMENT_SUMMARY| Request the employment summary of the Individual
          | INCOME_SUMMARY    | Request the income summary for the Individual
          | INCOME_EMPLOYMENT_DETAILS | Request the VOIE details of the Individual
          | HOME_INSURANCE_DETAILS | Request the Home insurance details of the individuals
          | AUTO_INSURANCE_DETAILS | Request the Auto insurance details of the individuals
          | REALIZED_GAINS    | Request 1099-B information from the Individual's brokerage account

        ### Items 

          Individuals permission access to documents online for your stated business purpose.   The permissioned documents that MeasureOne accesses and acquires are called *Items*.   Items can be in any format -- HTML, PDF, XML, JSON, etc.   Once the Item is acquired, it is parsed stored.  To enforce the permissions on the Item data,  access to the information in the Items is available solely through [Service APIs](https://docs.measureone.com).    This separation of the Item data from the Service APIs limits the scope of information to just what the Individual has authorized to share, independent of the underlying Item data used to generate it.   This ensures that you receive only the permissioned data and that the Individual's privacy is protected.


        ### Datasources

          The online location of Items is called a *Data Source*.  Data Sources are typically online accounts that are owned by the Individual.   The Individual gives explicit consent to MeasureOne to access their Data Source account and retrieve the Items necessary to fulfill your Data Request.

    - name: API Keys and Access
      description: >
        MeasureOne authenticates your API requests using access tokens. If you do
        not include the `access_token` when making a request, MeasureOne returns
        an authentication error. 

        To gain access to the MeasureOne API, reach out to us on
        sales@measureone.com. Once you’ve completed the signup process, we’ll
        provide a live `client_id` & `secret` for use in our API.


        You can access our APIs using Access Tokens Or Public Tokens. The Public
        Tokens are short lived with limited scope while Access Tokens are long
        lived. 


        ## Access Tokens

        Access Tokens are long-lived tokens that give you access to the MeasureOne
        infrastructure for your account. 

          **Access tokens should be used only from your own server side applications.**



        ## Public Tokens


        Public tokens are short-lived tokens with defined `scope` and `policy`. 

        The scope indicates the resources and endpoints you can access using these
        tokens while policy indicates the data you can access using the APIs.


        MeasureOne APIs will return a 401 error if the public token is used for
        scope or policy that is different from the token's scope and policy.


        **For example**, if you create a public token for policy having
        **individual_id** `idv_293241AAjy2EZt3R` and if you try to invoke
        /individuals/get_by_id for another individual, it will return a 401 error.


        The table below defines the currently supported scope.

    - name: Versioning
      description: >
        The current major version of the MeasureOne API is 3.0, and is passed in
        the API path as a `/v3` prefix.   The current 3.0 API version is
        `20210117` and is passed as a request header while calling the API. If no
        version number is specified in the request header, the API will default to
        the version that was live when you first signed up for MeasureOne API
        keys. 

        We periodically release changes to our APIs. While we try to remain
        backward compatible, changes in our API may result in changes to the data
        or schema structures exposed in the current version.

    - name: AsynchronousCommunication
      x-displayName: Asynchronous Communication
      description: >



        Many of MeasureOne APIs are asynchronous in nature. Client applications
        integrating MeasureOne API are required to expose endpoints for MeasureOne
        to send the [Webhook Notifications](https://docs.measureone.com).

        The diagram below depicts how the asynchronous communication will work. 
        APIs having Asynchronous communication may also send a synchronous
        response if the response is readily available.

        MeasureOne Link is a front-end component that provides you all the
        capabilities necessary to initiate the the consumer-permissioning workflow
        for your users.  It enables your users to permit your application to
        access their data in a consumer-permissioned manner.



        Link handles the consent, the data source identification, the credential
        collection, and the integration with the MeasureOne platform to access and
        acquire the consumer-permissioned data. It handles a variety of
        authentication mechanisms including multi-factor authentication and offers
        various configuration options to tailor the UI to your application. 


        As an alternative to the embedded widget, MeasureOne supports hosted
        solutions of Link, providing no-code options for your integrations. 
        Please login to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.measureone.com) for more
        details.

    - name: Integration
      description: >

        Integration of Link is done using a small snippet of javascript that can
        be displayed in any part of your application. 


        Widget integration requires the `m1-link` tag and a set of [configuration
        options](https://docs.measureone.com) as shown in the sample configuration
        JSON.


        Link raises [events](https://docs.measureone.com) for various user actions
        that your application can subscribe to. In addition to these events, the
        MeasureOne platform communicates with the client application via
        [webhooks](https://docs.measureone.com). 


        The LINK javascript is available at the links below

        <a id='datasources'></a> Data Sources are online locations of Items.  
        Individuals (your users) connect Data Sources and provide MeasureOne with
        their credentials and consent so that MeasureOne may retrieve Items (their
        data) from the Data Source to be subsequently shared with you in a
        strictly permissioned way.    


        Data Sources may be universities, financial institutions, payroll systems,
        government records.    MeasureOne curates the list of Data Sources to
        ensure the provenance of the retrieved documents.   Since not all Data
        Sources may be relevant to your application, the API allows you to
        configure and select the list of Data Sources that are displayed to your
        user.
    - name: Items
      description: >
        Items are the resource representing data shared by Individuals with
        MeasureOne.   The underlying document of an Item is called *source data* 
        These can be college transcripts, pay stubs, real estate titles, etc.  
        Items are stored and information from them can be retrieved through the
        Service API calls.   The information in an Item is shared through the
        Service APIs according to the consumer permission.   Importantly, note
        that unless permissioned by the Individual, the Item data may not be
        shared directly with you.

      description: >

        MeasureOne provides a robust document processing infrastructure for items
        acquired through consumer-permissions.  To process a document you need
        create an item using `/items/new` endpoint. Once an item is created, you
        can call the `/items/get_by_id` to get the digital version of the
        document. Below are the data types for each source data type supported by
        MeasureOne
    - name: Data Requests
      x-displayName: Data Requests
      description: >
        A consumer-permissioned data workflow is initiated and defined by the Data
        Request resource.   A Data Request specifies or bind together the various
        elements of a consumer-permissioned data workflow, in particular: the
        Individual, the type of data requested, the reports to be generated, the
        Link experience, optional Individual communication and messaging.   The
        consumer experience powered by [MeasureOne
        Link](https://docs.measureone.com) is specified by the required
        `datarequest_id`. MeasureOne supports multiple types of data requests
        catering to different use cases. All services accept `datarequest_id` as a
        reference.

        MeasureOne offers a framework for initiating the consumer-permissioned
        data exchange using automatically generated invitations.    These
        invitations contain unique links that refer the user back to the
        MeasureOne hosted portal in a personalized manner to initiate and complete
        the consumer-permissioned data exchange.     These API endpoints provide a
        programmatic interface to this framework.   Note that a zero code
        alternative to a programmatic implementation is to use the MeasureOne
        Customer Dashboard to interface with the Invitations framework.

        designated webhook URL with information about the event. The webhook URL
        is configured as part of the onboarding process. You can also provide the

      x-displayName: Migrating to 3.0
      description: >+
        ## Overview

        Version 3.0 of the MeasureOne API introduced many new features and
        capabilites.   Unfortunately, it is not backward compatible with v2.0.  
        This guide will walk you through the backward incompatible changes that
        you need to be aware of while migrating to 3.0



        ### Endpoint Migration

        The changes in URL will be applicable if you are using the following
        endpoints


        |V2.0|V3.0|

        |----------|----------|

        | /individual/get_academic_summary |/services/get_academic_summary

        | /individual/get_enrollment_status |/services/get_enrollment_status

        | /transcripts/new |/items/new

        | /schools/get |/datasources/get

        | /transcripts/new | /items/new

        | /transcripts/get_by_id | /items/get_by_id

        | /transcripts/get_files | /items/get_files

        | /analytics/meritscore | /services/meritscore

        | /analytics/gradscore | /services/gradscore



        ### Payload Changes

        This section depicts the changes you may have to do in your 

        #### Get Academic Summary


        `individual.datasource_id` has now changed to `individual.datasources`.
        You can now pass multiple datasource_ids to get the academic_summary


        ```json


        {
            "individual": {
            "individual_id": "idv_Cevp4Jw9CIsEeNjpgAAjy2EZt3R",
            "datasources": ["sch_CaIGVqBRRpETI6fkCyUSpNHbHFo", "sch_CaIGVqBRRpETI6fkCyUS233fbHFo"] // changes in 3.0
            }   
        }


        ```


        #### Get Enrollment Status


        `individual.datasource_id` has now changed to `individual.datasources`.
        You can now pass multiple datasource_ids to get the academic_summary


        ```json


        {
            "individual": {
            "individual_id": "idv_Cevp4Jw9CIsEeNjpgAAjy2EZt3R",
            "datasources": ["sch_CaIGVqBRRpETI6fkCyUSpNHbHFo", "sch_CaIGVqBRRpETI6fkCyUS233fbHFo"] // changes in 3.0
            }   
        }


        ```

        #### Creating a new item


        `source_data_type` has should now be at the top of the payload.


        ```json


        {
          "external_id": "ABCDECD",
          "individual_id": "idv_Cevp4Jw9CIsEeNjpgAAjy2EZt3R",
          "source_data_type": "M1_DIGEST", // changes in 3.0
          "source_data": [
            {
              "referrer": "USER",
              "source_data_value": {
                "degree_type": "BACHELORS",
                "years_in_school": 2,
                "min_grade": "D",
                "cgpa": 3.3,
                "last_term_gpa": 3.5,
                "credits_earned": 65
              }
            }
          ]
        }


        ```

        <br>


        ### Migrating to Data Requests

        A consumer-permissioned data workflow is initiated and defined by the Data
        Request resource. A Data Request specifies or binds together the various
        elements of a consumer-permissioned data workflow, in particular: the
        Individual, the type of data requested, the reports to be generated, the
        Link experience, optional Individual communication, and messaging.

        Migrating to Data Request is an important step required to leverage all
        the features of MeasureOne

        If you are using v3 of MeasureOne, and not using Data Requests, the
        following are the steps you should take.

        - After <a
        href="#tag/Individuals/paths/~1v3~1individuals~1new/post">creating the
        Individual</a>, create a new Data Request using this <a
        href="#tag/Data-Requests/paths/~1v3~1datarequests~1new/post">endpoint</a>

        - Once the Data Request is created, pass the `datarequest_id` in the <a
        href="#tag/Configuration">Link Configuration</a> in the Widget

        - Subscribe to webhooks - <a
        href="#tag/webhooks/paths/datarequest.updates_available/post">datarequest.updates_available</a>
        and <a
        href="#tag/webhooks/paths/datarequest.acquisition_complete/post">datarequest.acquisition_complete</a>
        to receive updates

        - On receiving the webhooks, you can now call our <a
        href="http://localhost:8080/#tag/Education/paths/~1v3~1services~1get_academic_summary/post">Service
        APIs</a> as you do in the existing integration.

        - You can also pass `datarequest_id` in the service call to get data
        pertaining to the data request.

          ### Usage options 
            The usage of `/v3/items/new` varies depending on its intended use and availability of information. The request payload must include either a `source_data_value` object **OR** a `source_data_reference` object. Passing both as a part of the payload may result in processing errors.

            #### Using Source Data Object
            If the attribute values for a transcript are known, send the source data inline in the request using the `source_data_value` object. 

            #### Using Source Data Reference Object

            If the data is in a document, upload it using the [`/items/upload`](https://docs.measureone.com) endpoint or make it available at a remote location. A reference to the uploaded document should then be included in the request using the `source_data_reference` object.

          Retrieves an existing Item data. The endpoint can be used once the
          `processing_status` for an Item is `COMPLETED`. It will return Item data
          in its response payload. If the processing of the Item is not yet
          complete, it will return the current status of the Item. This API is
          [asynchronous](https://docs.measureone.com). 


          The optional `data_confidence` object, if present, lists data attributes
          whose extraction accuracy was lower than 95%. Such a scenario can come
          up when processing images or other unstructured source data items. The
          attributes are specified as a json path within the corresponding data
          object. In the event that the `data_confidence` object is not present
          (i.e., null), the data extraction should be considered 100% accurate.

          Retrieves an summary of an Individual's employment based on employment
          related Items, including history and status. MeasureOne uses a set of
          heuristics to make a final determination. These heuristics are
          summarized in Reason Codes as detailed in the following table.

          You can share the invitation link with the Individual for them to
          complete the Data Request. The invitation link will direct the user to
          MeasureOne's hosted solution. 


          * If there is a invitation link with status `ACTIVE` available, it will
          return the same invitation link. Generating a invitation link when there
          is already existing `ACTIVE` available. it  will return the same
          invitation link with the  `expires_at` updated as provided. 

          * It will generate a new invitation link if there are no `ACTIVE` links
          available for the Data Request.
