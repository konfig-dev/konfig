          This endpoint creates a new Replica that can be used to generate
          personalized videos. 


          The only required body parameter is `train_video_url`. This url must be
          a download link such as a presigned S3 url. Please ensure you pass in a
          video that meets the
          [requirements](https://docs.tavusapi.com/api-reference) for
          training.


          Replica training will fail without the following consent statement being
          present at the beginning of the video:

          > I, [FULL NAME], am currently speaking and consent Tavus to create an
          AI clone of me by using the audio and video samples I provide. I
          understand that this AI clone can be used to create videos that look and
          sound like me.


          Learn more about the consent statement
          [here](https://docs.tavusapi.com/api-reference).

          This endpoint generates a new video using a Replica and a script. 


          The only required body parameters are `replica_id` and `script`. The
          `replica_id` is a unique identifier for the Replica that will be used to
          generate the video. The `script` is the text that will be spoken by the
          Replica in the video.


          If a `background_url` is provided, Tavus will record a video of the
          website and use it as the background for the video. If a
          `background_source_url` is provided, where the URL points to a download
          link such as a presigned S3 URL, Tavus will use the video as the
          background for the video. If neither are provided, the video will
          consist of a full screen Replica.


          To learn more about generating videos with Replicas, see
          [here](https://docs.tavusapi.com/api-reference).


          To learn more about writing an effective script for your video, see
