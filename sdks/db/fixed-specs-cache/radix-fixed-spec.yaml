      <p>Job and profile matching using Artificial Intelligence.</p>

      <h1>What is it?</h1>

      <p>Talent API is a system that allows retrieving jobs recommendations for a
      profile or profiles recommendations for a job.<br>

      There are three types of entities involved:</p>

      <ul>

      <li>The <code>job</code>: a JSON document describing a job offer.</li>

      <li>The <code>profile</code>: a JSON document describing a user
      profile.</li>

      <li>The <code>match</code>: a JSON document describing a link between a job
      and a profile. Getting started Here is a description of a<br>
        basic use of the API using curl. In the examples, words between brackets need to be replaced by the appropriate value.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Credentials</h4>

      <p>You need a <code>client_id</code> and a <code>client_secret</code> in
      order to have access to the API. If you don't have credentials, please<br>

      contact us at <a href="hello@radix.ai">hello@radix.ai</a>. These credentials
      will also come with the scope you are allowed to use.</p>

      <p>Using these, you can authenticate at the /auth endpoint and receive an
      access_token. This access_token will be needed<br>

      for the next requests.</p>

      <p>The request should look like</p>

      <pre><code>curl -X POST \
        https://[server-url]/auth \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
                 &quot;client_id&quot;: &quot;[client_id]&quot;, \
                 &quot;client_secret&quot;: &quot;[client_secret]&quot;, \
                 &quot;scope&quot;:&quot;tapi/ALL&quot;
            }'
      </code></pre>

      <p>The response will be</p>

      <pre><code>{
        &quot;access_token&quot;:&quot;eyJjIs7iOiJ[...]vQZUUhw2fsg&quot;,
        &quot;expires_in&quot;:3600,
        &quot;token_type&quot;:&quot;Bearer&quot;
      }

      </code></pre>

      <h4>Sending data</h4>

      <p>Before being able to request recommendations, you need to provide data.
      The minimum is a profile and a job.</p>

      <h4>Send a job</h4>

      <p>Here is a sample request of how to send us a job.</p>

      <p>The example uses the smallest set of fields necessary for the query to
      work, but you should fill as many of them as<br>

      possible.</p>

      <p>The field client_data can be used to send fields that are specific to
      your corporation that cannot be mapped to the API<br>

      specification. Please note that using client specific fields is discouraged
      if your fields are non-critical or can be<br>

      translated into predefined fields.</p>

      <pre><code>curl -X POST \
        http://[server-url]/jobs \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJjIs7iOiJ[...]vQZUUhw2fsg' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
                &quot;external_id&quot; : &quot;12345&quot;,
                &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A job title&quot;,
                &quot;addresses&quot;: [&quot;The job address&quot;],
                &quot;publication_datetime&quot; : &quot;2020-02-12 00:02:00&quot;,
                &quot;expiration_datetime&quot; :  &quot;2020-02-12 00:02:00&quot;,
                &quot;may_be_recommended&quot; : true,
                &quot;may_receive_recommendations&quot; : true
      }'

      </code></pre>

      <p>You will receive the following response, confirming that we received the
      job and processed it correctly:</p>

      <pre><code>{
          &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Job successfully received. Recommendations will be available once the job has been processed.&quot;
      }

      </code></pre>

      <h4>Send a profile</h4>

      <p>In the same fashion, to send us a profile</p>

      <pre><code>curl -X POST \
        http://[server-url]/profiles \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJjIs7iOiJ[...]vQZUUhw2fsg' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -d '{
                &quot;external_id&quot; : &quot;6789&quot;,
                &quot;addresses&quot;: [&quot;The addresses where the candidate lives.&quot;],
                &quot;publication_datetime&quot; : &quot;2008-02-12 00:02:00&quot;,
                &quot;expiration_datetime&quot; :  &quot;2008-02-12 00:02:00&quot;,
                &quot;may_be_recommended&quot; : true,
                &quot;may_receive_recommendations&quot; : true
      }'

      </code></pre>

      <p>And the response will be</p>

      <pre><code>{
        &quot;message&quot;: &quot;Profile successfully received. Recommendations will be available once the profile has been processed.&quot;,
      }

      </code></pre>

      <h4>Get a recommendation</h4>

      <p>Now that there is a job and a profile in the system, you can ask for a
      recommendation. For example, in order to get the<br>

      best jobs for the profile you just uploaded, you can do the following
      request</p>

      <pre><code>curl -X GET \
        http://[server-url]/profile/123456789/jobs \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJjIs7iOiJ[...]vQZUUhw2fsg' \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      </code></pre>

      <p>The response will contain a list of the best jobs for that profile, in
      the following form</p>

      <pre><code>[
          {
            &quot;resource_id&quot;: 12345
            &quot;score&quot;: 0.87
            &quot;resource&quot;: {
              &quot;external_id&quot; : &quot;12345&quot;,
              &quot;title&quot;: &quot;A job title&quot;,
              &quot;addresses&quot;: [&quot;The job address&quot;],
              &quot;publication_datetime&quot; : &quot;2020-02-12 00:02:00&quot;,
              &quot;expiration_datetime&quot; :  &quot;2020-02-12 00:02:00&quot;,
              &quot;may_be_recommended&quot; : true,
              &quot;may_receive_recommendations&quot; : true
            },
            &quot;match_explanation&quot;: {
            }
          },
          ...
      ]

      </code></pre>

      <p>These recommendations are based on the data that you included when
      uploading jobs and profiles to Talent API. To receive<br>

      high quality recommendations, make sure to fill as many fields as possible
      when uploading entities.</p>

      <h4>Send a match indicator</h4>

      <p>If you want the recommendation to improve based on your user behaviour,
      you need to send us <code>match indicators</code>. A match<br>

      indicator represents a link between a profile and a job. As an example, if
      the user with profile_id <code>6789</code> had a look at<br>

      the job page with id <code>12345</code>, you can send us the following
      match:</p>

      <pre><code>curl -X POST \
        https://[server-url]/matches \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOi[...]Mou8GdpvnA'
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
        -d '{
               'profile_id':'6789',
               'job_id':'12345',
               'match_actor':'CANDIDATE',
               'match_datetime':'2020-03-14T21:37:38.414Z',
               'match_type':'PAGEVIEW'
            }'
      </code></pre>

      <p>That way, we are aware of user interactions inside of your data.</p>

      <h4>View your data status</h4>

      <p>To have a look at what you currently sent us, call the
      <code>status</code> endpoint:</p>

      <pre><code>curl -X GET \
        https://[server-url]/status \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJraWQiOi[...]Mou8GdpvnA'
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' 
      </code></pre>
