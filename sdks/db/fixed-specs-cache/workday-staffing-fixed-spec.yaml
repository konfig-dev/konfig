        /workers/{ID}/jobChanges method, which returns the new job change ID. 


        2. Update data for the job change request by calling the PATCH
        /jobChanges/{id}/{subResource}/{subResourceID} endpoints. Specify the new
        job change ID as the {ID} and {subResourceID} path parameters. 


        3. Submit the job change request by calling the POST
        /jobChanges/{ID}/submit endpoint. The updated data in the preceding job
        change PATCH requests do not persist until you call POST
        /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.

          Initiates an organization assignment change for a specific worker.

          Call this method to start a new change organization assignment event,
          which returns a new change organization assignment ID. Use the new ID to
          reference the change organization assignment event in subsequent methods
          that update or get information about the same event.


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this POST method.  The
          updates in this POST method do not persist until you call POST
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify at least this required field: date, worker
          {id}, job {id}


          To retrieve a worker ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/workers prompt endpoint with
          the effectiveDate query parameter. It returns HREF links to workers by
          category. You can filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it
          returns workers on the current date. Only workers without blocking
          events or available for organization assignment change for the current
          user are returned.


          To retrieve a job ID, call the
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/jobs prompt endpoint with the
          worker query parameter.  It returns all positions for the worker with
          current user access to do an organization assignment change . You can
          filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns positions on
          the current date.

          Partially updates the start details for the specified job change ID. 

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/startDetails/{subResourceID} to get
          the existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify at least these request fields: date,
          reason{id}. 


          To retrieve a reason ID, call the GET /values/jobChangesGroup/reason
          prompt endpoint, which takes the job change ID as the staffingEvent
          query parameter. If you specify the staffingEvent parameter, it returns
          change job reasons for the staffingEvent, by the change job category. By
          default, it returns all change job categories and reasons.

          ID.


          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/jobProfile/{subResourceID} to get the
          existing data to update.


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify at least this required field:
          jobProfile{id}


          To retrieve a jobProfile ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/jobProfiles prompt endpoint, which takes the job
          change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
          staffingEvent parameter, it returns HREF links to the job profiles by
          the prompt category. If you don't specify the staffingEvent parameter,
          it returns all job profiles, regardless of their categories. You can
          also filter the job profiles by the effectiveDate query parameter. The
          default is the current date.

          Partially updates the location options for the specified job change ID. 

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/location/{subResourceID} to get the
          existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify at least this request field: location{id}. 


          To retrieve a location ID, you can call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/locations prompt endpoint, which takes the job
          change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. It returns HREF links to
          locations by location categories for the staffingEvent. You can filter
          the results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns locations on the
          current date. 


          To retrieve a workShift ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/workShifts prompt endpoint with the location
          query parameter. It returns work shifts by location. If you don't
          specify the location parameter, it returns an empty result.


          To retrieve a workSpace ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/workSpaces prompt endpoint with the location
          query parameter. It returns HREF links to workspaces by configured
          prompt categories for the specified location. You can filter the results
          by effectiveDate. By default, it returns workspaces on the current date.

          organization assignment change ID. 

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/customorganization/{subResourceID}
          to get the existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the custom organization
          {id}


          To retrieve a custom organization ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/customs prompt endpoint,
          which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
          parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
          the custom organizations, as of the event's effective date. If you don't
          specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the active custom
          organizations based on the current date.

          Partially updates the business unit option for the specified change
          organization assignment ID.

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/businessUnit/{subResourceID} to get
          the existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the business unit. 


          To retrieve a businessUnit ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/businessUnit prompt endpoint,
          which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
          parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
          the business units by organization, as of the event's effective date. If
          you don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the
          business units by active organization based on the current date.

          You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/moveTeam/{subResourceID} to get the

          Partially updates the position options for the specified job change ID.

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/startDetails/{subResourceID} to get
          the existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify at least these request fields:
          position{id}, createPosition, closePosition, availableForOverlap


          To retrieve a position ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/proposedPosition prompt endpoint, which takes
          the job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. It returns HREF
          links to proposed positions based on staffing event for contingent
          workers. You can filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it
          returns all proposed positions on current date.

          change ID.

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/administrative/{subResourceID} to get
          the existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


          Note that there are no localization constraints in this API version. You
          can update the workingFTE and paidFTE fields even if the fields have not
          been localized.


          To retrieve a positionWorkerType ID, you can call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/employeeTypes prompt endpoint, with
          staffingEvent and location query parameters. If you specify the
          staffingEvent parameter, it returns HREF links to employee types by
          country. By default, it returns all employee types, excluding contingent
          workers.


          For the positionWorkerType ID, you can also call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/contingentWorkerTypes prompt endpoint, with
          staffingEvent and location query parameters. If you specify the
          staffingEvent parameter, it returns HREF links to contingent worker
          types for staffing event. If you specify location, it returns HREF links
          to contingent worker types by location or country. By default, it
          returns all contingent worker types.


          To retrieve a workersCompensationCodeOverride ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/workersCompensationCodeOverrides prompt
          endpoint, which takes the job change ID as the staffing Event query
          parameter. 


          To retrieve a payRateType ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/payRateTypes prompt endpoint, which takes the
          job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. It returns all pay
          rate types based on staffing event for contingent workers. By default,
          it returns all pay rate types in the tenant. 


          To retrieve companyInsiderType IDs, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/companyInsiderTypes prompt endpoint, which
          returns all company insider types in the tenant. 


          To retrieve an assignmentType ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/assignmentTypes prompt endpoint, which takes the
          job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
          staffingEvent parameter, it returns assignmentTypes for the
          staffingEvent. By default, it returns all active assignment types.


          To retrieve a workStudy ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/workStudyAwards prompt endpoint, which takes the
          job change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
          staffingEvent parameter, it returns work study awards for the
          staffingEvent. By default, it returns all work studies in the tenant.


          To retrieve a timeType ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/timeTypes prompt endpoint, which takes the job
          change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
          staffingEvent parameter, it returns time types for the staffingEvent. By
          default, it returns all time types based on the Relax Hiring
          Restrictions tenant configuration.

          Partially updates the company for the specified organization assignment
          change ID. 

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/company/{subResourceID} to get the
          existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the company. 


          To retrieve a companies ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/companies prompt endpoint,
          which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
          parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
          the companies by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
          don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the
          companies by active organization based on the current date.

          Partially updates the costing organizations for the specified
          organization assignment change ID. Costing organizations include:
          Grants, Funds, Programs, and Gifts.

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/costing/{subResourceID} to get the
          existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the grant, program, gift,
          or fund you want to update.


          To retrieve a grants ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/grants prompt endpoint, which
          takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
          parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
          the grants by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
          don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the grants
          by active organization based on the current date. 


          To retrieve a funds ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/funds prompt endpoint, which
          takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
          parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
          the funds by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
          don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the funds by
          active organization based on the current date. 


          To retrieve a programs ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/programs prompt endpoint,
          which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
          parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
          the programs by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
          don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the programs
          by active organization based on the current date. 


          To retrieve a gifts ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/gifts prompt endpoint, which
          takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
          parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
          the gifts by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
          don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the gifts by
          active organization based on the current date.

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the region. 


          To retrieve a regions ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/regions prompt endpoint,
          which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
          parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
          the regions by organization, as of the event's effective date. If you
          don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the regions
          by active organization based on the current date.

          To submit the Change Job event and initiate the Change Job business
          process, specify an empty request body: {}.

          To save for later, specify this request body:

          {
              "businessProcessParameters": {
                  "action":{
                      "id": "d9e41a8c446c11de98360015c5e6daf6"
                  }
              }
          }


          The action id value is the Workday ID of the "Save for Later" action. If
          you submit this endpoint with the Save for Later action, you can no
          longer edit nor resubmit the Change Job event using the REST APIs. The
          user with correct permissions can edit and submit the saved Change Job
          event in the Workday UI.

          Partially updates the job classifications for the specified job change
          ID. 

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/jobClassification/{subResourceID} to
          get the existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify at least this required field:
          additionalJobClassifications[ {id} ]. 


          To retrieve an additionalJobClassifications ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/jobClassifications prompt endpoint with the
          location and/or staffingEvent query parameter. It returns HREF links to
          job classifications by location for the staffing event. It returns an
          empty result if both location and staffingEvent are not specified. You
          can filter the results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns job
          classifications on the current date.

          Initiates a job change request for a specific worker

          Call this method to start a new job change event, which returns a new
          job change ID. Use the new ID to reference the job change event in
          subsequent methods that update or get information about the same event.


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this POST method.  The
          updates in this POST method do not persist until you call POST
          /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify at least this required field: date, worker
          {id}, job {id}, reason {id}


          To retrieve a worker ID, call the GET /values/jobChangesGroup/workers
          prompt endpoint with the effectiveDate query parameter. It returns HREF
          links to workers by category. You can filter the results by
          effectiveDate. By default, it returns workers on the current date. Only
          workers without blocking events or available for change job for the
          current user are returned.


          To retrieve a job ID, call the GET /values/jobChangesGroup/jobs prompt
          endpoint with the worker query parameter.  It returns all positions for
          the worker with current user access to do a job change. You can filter
          the results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns positions on the
          current date. 


          To retrieve a reason ID, call the GET /values/jobChangesGroup/reason
          prompt endpoint, which takes the job change ID as the staffingEvent
          query parameter. If you specify the staffingEvent parameter, it returns
          change job reasons for the staffingEvent, by the change job category. By
          default, it returns all change job categories and reasons.


          To retrieve a supervisoryOrganization ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/supervisoryOrganization prompt endpoint, with
          proposedManager and effectiveDate query parameters. If you specify the
          proposedManager parameter, it returns HREF links to all supervisory
          organizations for that manager. If you specify effectiveDate, it filters
          the results by effective date. The default is the current date.


          To retrieve a location ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/locations prompt endpoint, which takes the
          staffingEvent query parameter.  It returns HREF links to locations by
          location categories for the specified location. You can filter the
          results by effectiveDate. By default, it returns locations on the
          current date.

          Partially updates the cost center for the specified organization
          assignment change ID. 

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/costCenter/{subResourceID} to get
          the existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The data
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /organizationAssignmentChanges/{ID}/submit.


          In the request body, specify the Workday ID of the cost center. 


          To retrieve a costCenter ID, call the GET
          /values/organizationAssignmentChangesGroup/costCenters prompt endpoint,
          which takes the change organization assignment ID as the event query
          parameter. If you specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to
          the cost centers by organization, as of the event's effective date. If
          you don't specify the event parameter, it returns HREF links to the cost
          centers by active organization based on the current date.

          Partially updates the contract details options for the specified job
          change ID.

          The {subResourceID} path parameter must be the same as the {ID} value.


          You can call GET /jobChanges/{ID}/contract/{subResourceID} to get the
          existing data to update. 


          The same Workday UI validations apply with this PATCH method. The
          updates in this PATCH method do not persist until you call POST
          /jobChanges/{ID}/submit.



          To retrieve a frequency ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/frequencies prompt endpoint, which takes the job
          change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. It returns all
          frequencies based on staffing event for contingent workers. By default,
          it returns all frequencies in the tenant.


          To retrieve a currency ID, call the GET
          /values/jobChangesGroup/currencies prompt endpoint, which takes the job
          change ID as the staffingEvent query parameter. If you specify the
          staffingEvent parameter, it returns HREF links to active currencies by
          prompt category. By default, it returns all active currencies.
