          Add a company level job. If a client has their job numbering structured
          in 2-3 separate 'segments', you may need to first do a GET on the
          jobsegements endpoint, so you can see how many segments and the
          character length of each segment, as well as the name of those segments,
          which you will need to have before you POST.

          Add one or more workers to a specific company that your application has
          been granted access to. These workers will be added with an IN_PROGRESS
          status assigned to them.  In_Progress workers will pre-populated within
          Paychex Flex and will require someone to complete them to be fully
          available with the Flex platform.  Paychex Flex UI will hold a majority
          of validation, rules, and enforced required fields based on the clients
          configuration.  Required fields are givenName, familyName, & workerType
          (when adding multiple workers at a time you will need to also include a
          "workerCorrelationId" data element on each worker, that will be used as
          an identifier in our responses). Optionally you can include a workers
          communications object within the worker.  Once generated the IN_PROGRESS
          worker can have their communications, Compensation and Federal Taxes
          POSTed and PATCHed using the generated workerId.

        summary: Worker Contacts
        description: >-
          Add one or more contacts to a worker. A contact may represent a person
          or entity (organization) but not both. A contact must have at least one
          communication (telecom, postal, or email). Person contacts can have
          multiple communications for each communication type (telecom, postal, or
          email) to support BUSINESS and PERSONAL. Exactly one contact must be
          marked as primary for each contact type. If one or more contacts are
          posted for the same contact type, and there are currently no contacts of
          that type for the worker, the first contact in the list will be made
          primary unless another in the list is expressly marked as primary. When
          a new contact is made primary the previous primary contact will be
          marked as not primary. Use the GET /companies/{companyId}/contacttypes
          endpoint to get a full list of available contact types and relationship
          types (used for person contacts).

        summary: Worker Contacts
        description: >-
          Update a worker contact. A contact may represent a person or entity
          (organization) but not both. A contact must have at least one
          communication (telecom, postal, or email). Person contacts can have
          multiple communications for each communication type (telecom, postal, or
          email) to support BUSINESS and PERSONAL. Exactly one contact must be
          marked as primary for each contact type. When a new contact is made
          primary the previous primary contact will be marked as not primary. A
          postal contact can be switched from a street address to a PO box and
          vice versa. This is done by setting either streetLineOne or
          postOfficeBox (a postal communication may not have both). Use the GET
          /companies/{companyId}/contacttypes endpoint to get a full list of
          available contact types and relationship types (used for person
          contacts).

          webhook, you will need to provide your own URI in the request body (see
          our <a href='https://developer.paychex.com/resources/webhooks'>full
          webhook documention here</a> on how to configure your URI). The newly

          payloads which vary by domain. Please configure your endpoint to accept
          the relevant payloads. To see an example payload for each domain, please
