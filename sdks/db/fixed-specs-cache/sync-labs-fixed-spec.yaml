  metaDescription: >-
    building generative models to modify + synthesize humans in video.


    the first product we released is our synchronizer – a state-of-the-art
    lip-syncing model to sync a video to any audio in any language.


    why is this important?


    Imagine a world where you can watch your favorite films, content creators,
    or learn anything you want in your native tongue — seamlessly.


    language should no longer be a barrier.


    we're building a suite of audio / video models to change how we live, work,
    and play.
