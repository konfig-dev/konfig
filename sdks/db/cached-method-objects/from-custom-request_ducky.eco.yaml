  Ducky Data's APIs provide footprint data for a wide variety of products and
  circular services, as well as individuals, and consumption-based emissions for
  municipalities and other administrative units.


  The endpoints are divided by functionality. 

  The Calculate endpoints compute the footprint of an individual based on their
  habits and other lifestyle data. 

  The Change endpoint generates climate friendly tips based on the user's
  habits, and can be used to nudge the user towards sutainable behavioral
  change.

  The Compare endpoints return the average footprint of a citizen in a given
  area (municipality or BSU).

  The Convert endpoints turn physical data like energy use or transaction amount
  into climate footprint.

  Reporting endpoints are for calculating scope 1 & 2 emissions according to the
  GHG protocol.

  The Track endpoints returns the values of indicators (drivers of footprint)
  for a given area (municipality or BSU).

  The Translate endpoints contextualize a given quantity of CO2e by expressing
  them in something more tangible, like a flight trip.


  In the description of each endpoint, you will find the link to a user
  documentation page detailing the sources and calculation principles.

  All of our user documentation pages can be found
  [here](https://support.ducky.eco/en/ducky-insights#introduction-to-ducky-insights).


  ### Base URL

  The API is served over HTTPS.

  The section [API Servers](https://storage.googleapis.com) indicates the base
  URLs for all requests in the documentation.


  ### Authentication

  The API requires [authentication](https://storage.googleapis.com). You have to
  negotiate an `access_token` and send it with every request, in the
  `authorization` header.


  Step-by-step:

  1. [Email Ducky to request](mailto:api@ducky.eco) a `CLIENT_ID` and a
  `CLIENT_SECRET`

  2. Negotiate an `access_token` with Auth0

  3. Send authenticated requests to Ducky API


  Learn in detail how to negotiate and use an `access_token` in the
  [Authentication section](https://storage.googleapis.com).
