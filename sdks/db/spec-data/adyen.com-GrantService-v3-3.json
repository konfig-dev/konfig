Learn more about [Adyen Capital](https://docs.adyen.com/marketplaces-and-platforms/capital).\n\n## Authentication\nYour Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value, for example:\n\n ```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n...\n```\n\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-U \"ws@BalancePlatform.YOUR_BALANCE_PLATFORM\":\"YOUR_WS_PASSWORD\" \\\n...\n```\n## Roles and permissions\nTo use the Capital API, you need an additional role for your API credential. Your Adyen contact will set up the roles and permissions for you.\n## Versioning\nThe Capital API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://balanceplatform-api-test.adyen.com/btl/v3/grants\n```\n## Going live\nWhen going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the username and password to send requests to `https://balanceplatform-api-live.adyen.com/btl/v3`.\n\n",
