  "apiDescription": "The API uses OAuth2 client creadentials flow. To get the Bearer token for the resources you have to request the token by using route '/token', found from Authentication controller.\r\n\r\nYou need to provide a Client_Id, client_secret and scope needed. The client_id and client_secret can be obtained from Severa UI Rest Api settings section.\r\n\r\nAfter authentication, calls need to use the Bearer token as authorization header (Bearer {accessToken}). The calls also need to have Client_Id header.\r\n\r\nThe access token can be refreshed from '/refreshtoken' route using the refresh token which was obtained from the authentication.\r\n\r\n",
