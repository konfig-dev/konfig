  "apiDescription": "The Legal Entity Management API enables you to manage legal entities that contain information required for verification. \n## Authentication\nYour Adyen contact will provide your API credential and an API key. To connect to the API, add an `X-API-Key` header with the API key as the value. For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"X-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\nAlternatively, you can use the username and password of your API credential to connect to the API using basic authentication. For example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-U \"ws_123456@Scope.Company_YOUR_COMPANY_ACCOUNT\":\"YourWsPassword\" \\\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n...\n```\n## Versioning\nThe Legal Entity Management API supports [versioning](https://docs.adyen.com/development-resources/versioning) using a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://kyc-test.adyen.com/lem/v2/legalEntities\n```\n>If you are using hosted onboarding and just beginning your integration, use v3 for your API requests. Otherwise, use v2.\n\n## Going live\nWhen going live, your Adyen contact will provide your API credential for the live environment. You can then use the API key or the username and password to send requests to `https://kyc-live.adyen.com/lem/v2`.\n\n",
