  "apiDescription": "A web service containing utility functions available for merchants integrating with Checkout APIs.\n## Authentication\nEach request to the Checkout Utility API must be signed with an API key. For this, obtain an API Key from your Customer Area, as described in [How to get the Checkout API key](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/user-management/how-to-get-the-checkout-api-key). Then set this key to the `X-API-Key` header value, for example:\n\n```\ncurl\n-H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n-H \"X-API-Key: Your_Checkout_API_key\" \\\n...\n```\nNote that when going live, you need to generate a new API Key to access the [live endpoints](https://docs.adyen.com/developers/api-reference/live-endpoints).\n\n## Versioning\nCheckout API supports versioning of its endpoints through a version suffix in the endpoint URL. This suffix has the following format: \"vXX\", where XX is the version number.\n\nFor example:\n```\nhttps://checkout-test.adyen.com/v1/originKeys\n```",
