  "apiDescription": "The [Redact API](/redact/overview) helps organisations meet their privacy compliance obligations. It provides controlled, on-demand redaction of private information from transactional records in the long-term storage. Note, Redact API does not have the capability to redact the short-lived server logs that are retained for a few weeks. For SMS customers that need immediate redaction, Vonage suggests using [Advanced Auto-redact](/redact/overview#auto-redact-vs-redact-api).",
