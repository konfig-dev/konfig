The easiest way to interact with the API is with\n[tbnctl](https://docs.turbinelabs.io/advanced/tbnctl.html).\nIf you want to make direct HTTP calls, however, you can obtain an access\ntoken using tbnctl, and then pass it in the Authorization header,\nprefixed by `Token `:\n```console\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Token <access token>\" https://api.turbinelabs.io/v1.0/cluster\n```\n",
