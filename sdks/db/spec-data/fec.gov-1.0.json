      "description": "\nThis description is for both ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` and ​ `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/`.\n\nThis endpoint provides itemized receipts. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual, use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/). If you are interested in our \"is_individual\" methodology visit our [methodology page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/). \n​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number. This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes` object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters. \nFor example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information:\n\ncase #1:\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152643,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 43052850,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880619\",\n        last_contribution_receipt_date: \"2014-01-01\"\n    }\n}\n```\n<br/>\ncase #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL):\n\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152644,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 43052850,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880639\",\n        sort_null_only: True\n    }\n}\n```\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`. We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions may be unintentionally filtered out.\n\nCalls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through the records until no records are returned.\n\nTo avoid throwing the \"out of range\" exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results.\n\n​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that object class.\n\n",

      "description": "\nThis description is for both ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` and ​ `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/`.\n\nThis endpoint provides itemized receipts. Schedule A records describe itemized receipts, including contributions from individuals. If you are interested in contributions from an individual, use the `/schedules/schedule_a/` endpoint. For a more complete description of all Schedule A records visit [About receipts data](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/about-receipts-data/). If you are interested in our \"is_individual\" methodology visit our [methodology page](https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/about-campaign-finance-data/methodology/). \n​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/` endpoint is not paginated by page number. This endpoint uses keyset pagination to improve query performance and these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset. To request the next page, you should append the values found in the `last_indexes` object from pagination to the URL of your last request as additional parameters. \nFor example, when sorting by `contribution_receipt_date`, you might receive a page of results with the two scenarios of following pagination information:\n\ncase #1:\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152643,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 43052850,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880619\",\n        last_contribution_receipt_date: \"2014-01-01\"\n    }\n}\n```\n<br/>\ncase #2 (results which include contribution_receipt_date = NULL):\n\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 2152644,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 43052850,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230880639\",\n        sort_null_only: True\n    }\n}\n```\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230880619` and `last_contribution_receipt_date=2014-01-01` to the URL and when reaching `contribution_receipt_date=NULL`, append `last_index=230880639` and `sort_null_only=True`. We strongly advise paging through these results using sort indices. The default sort is acending by `contribution_receipt_date` (`deprecated`, will be descending). If you do not page using sort indices, some transactions may be unintentionally filtered out.\n\nCalls to ​`/schedules​/schedule_a​/` may return many records. For large result sets, the record counts found in the pagination object are approximate; you will need to page through the records until no records are returned.\n\nTo avoid throwing the \"out of range\" exception on the last page, one recommandation is to use total count and `per_page` to control the traverse loop of results.\n\n​The `/schedules​/schedule_a​/{sub_id}​/` endpoint returns a single transaction, but it does include a pagination object class. Please ignore the information in that object class.\n\n",

      "description": "\nSchedule B filings describe itemized disbursements. This data\nexplains how committees and other filers spend their money. These figures are\nreported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.\n\nThe data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\nis derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will\ndefault to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,\neven-numbered year.\n\nDue to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\npage number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 965191,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 19303814,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230906248\",\n        last_disbursement_date: \"2014-07-04\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and\n`last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g.\n`last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.\nThis resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\nand these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n",

These figures are\nreported as part of forms F3, F3X and F3P.\n\nThe data is divided in two-year periods, called `two_year_transaction_period`, which\nis derived from the `report_year` submitted of the corresponding form. If no value is supplied, the results will\ndefault to the most recent two-year period that is named after the ending,\neven-numbered year.\n\nDue to the large quantity of Schedule B filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\npage number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `disbursement_date`, you might receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\n```\npagination: {\n    pages: 965191,\n    per_page: 20,\n    count: 19303814,\n    last_indexes: {\n        last_index: \"230906248\",\n        last_disbursement_date: \"2014-07-04\"\n    }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=230906248` and\n`last_disbursement_date=2014-07-04` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date, e.g.\n`last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally filtered out.\nThis resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\nand these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the Schedule B data includes many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n",

For example, if a super PAC\nbought ads on TV to oppose a federal candidate, each ad purchase would be recorded here with\nthe expenditure amount, name and id of the candidate, and whether the ad supported or opposed the candidate.\n\nAn independent expenditure is an expenditure for a communication \"expressly advocating the election or\ndefeat of a clearly identified candidate that is not made in cooperation, consultation, or concert with,\nor at the request or suggestion of, a candidate, a candidate’s authorized committee, or their agents, or\na political party or its agents.\"\n\nAggregates by candidate do not include 24 and 48 hour reports. This ensures we don't double count expenditures\nand the totals are more accurate. You can still find the information from 24 and 48 hour reports in\n`/schedule/schedule_e/`.\n\nDue to the large quantity of Schedule E filings, this endpoint is not paginated by\npage number. Instead, you can request the next page of results by adding the values in\nthe `last_indexes` object from `pagination` to the URL of your last request. For\nexample, when sorting by `expenditure_amount`, you might receive a page of\nresults with the following pagination information:\n\n```\n \"pagination\": {\n    \"count\": 152623,\n    \"last_indexes\": {\n      \"last_index\": \"3023037\",\n      \"last_expenditure_amount\": -17348.5\n    },\n    \"per_page\": 20,\n    \"pages\": 7632\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo fetch the next page of sorted results, append `last_index=3023037` and\n`last_expenditure_amount=` to the URL.  We strongly advise paging through\nthese results by using the sort indices (defaults to sort by disbursement date,\ne.g. `last_disbursement_date`), otherwise some resources may be unintentionally\nfiltered out.  This resource uses keyset pagination to improve query performance\nand these indices are required to properly page through this large dataset.\n\nNote: because the Schedule E data includes many records, counts for\nlarge result sets are approximate; you will want to page through the records until no records are returned.\n",

  "apiDescription": "This application programming interface (API) allows you to explore the way candidates and committees fund their campaigns. \n\n The Federal Election Commission (FEC) API is a RESTful web service supporting full-text and field-specific searches on FEC data. [Bulk downloads](https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data) are available on the current site. Information is tied to the underlying forms by file ID and image ID. Data is updated nightly. \n\n There are a lot of data, and a good place to start is to use search to find interesting candidates and committees. Then, you can use their IDs to find report or line item details with the other endpoints. If you are interested in individual donors, check out contributor information in the `/schedule_a/` endpoints. \n\n <b class=\"body\" id=\"getting_started_head\">Getting started with the openFEC API</b><br> \n\n If you would like to use the FEC's API programmatically, you can sign up for your own API key using our form. Alternatively, you can still try out our API without an API key by using the web interface and using DEMO_KEY. Note that when you use the openFEC API you are subject to the [Terms of Service](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/TERMS-OF-SERVICE.md) and [Acceptable Use policy](https://github.com/fecgov/FEC/blob/master/ACCEPTABLE-USE-POLICY.md). \n\n Signing up for an API key will enable you to place up to 1,000 calls an hour. Each call is limited to 100 results per page. You can email questions, comments or a request to get a key for 7,200 calls an hour (120 calls per minute) to <a href=\"mailto:APIinfo@fec.gov\">APIinfo@fec.gov</a>. You can also ask questions and discuss the data in a community led [group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fec-data). \n\n The model definitions and schema are available at [/swagger](/swagger/). This is useful for making wrappers and exploring the data. \n\n A few restrictions limit the way you can use FEC data. For example, you can’t use contributor lists for commercial purposes or to solicit donations.
