For example,\n    we have also released the [IOTVAS NSE script](https://github.com/firmalyzer/iotvas-nmap) that turns the nmap port scanner \n    to a IoT/connected device discovery and real-time risk assessment tool. For more infromation on IoTVAS and other \n    solutions please visit [Firmalyzer web site](https://www.firmalyzer.com).",
