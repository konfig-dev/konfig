Since [bearer token authentication support is not explicitly supported in OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/issues/583), client code will vary.  Clients created with [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) should set `apiKeyPrefix` to `\"Bearer\"` and set `apiKey` to the token.  Other clients may need to set `apiKey` to the string `\"Bearer <token>\"`.\nNote that this should be [fixed in OpenAPI 3.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/pull/807)), whenever that becomes available and supported.\n#### User-Level API Keys\nTo use a user-level API key (prefixed with \"v2.\"), `basePath` must be changed to `/api/account/{accountName}` where `{accountName}` is the name of the account for which requests will be made.",
