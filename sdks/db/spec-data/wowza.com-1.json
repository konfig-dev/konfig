  "apiDescription": "\n# About the REST API\n\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud<sup>TM</sup> REST API (application programming interface) offers complete programmatic control over live streams, transcoders, stream sources, and stream targets. Anything you can do in the Wowza Streaming Cloud UI can also be achieved by making HTTP-based requests to cloud-based servers through the REST API.\n\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API features *cross-origin resource sharing*, or CORS.\nCORS is a [W3C specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) that provides headers in HTTP requests to enable a web server to safely make a network request to another domain.\n\nIn order to protect shared resources, the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API is subject to limits. For details, see [Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API limits](https://www.wowza.com/docs/wowza-streaming-cloud-rest-api-limits).\n# About this documentation\nThis reference documentation is based on the open-source [Swagger framework](http://swagger.io/specification/).\nIt allows you to view the operations, parameters, and request and reponse schemas for every resource. Request samples are presented in cURL (Shell) and JavaScript; some samples also include just the JSON object. Response samples are all JSON.\n\nFor more information and examples on using the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API, see our [library of Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API technical articles](https://www.wowza.com/docs/wowza-streaming-cloud-rest-api).\n\n# Query requirements\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API uses HTTP requests to retrieve data from cloud-based servers. Requests must contain proper JSON, two authentication keys, and the correct version number in the base path.\n\n## JSON\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API uses the [JSON API specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/) to request and return data. This means requests must include the header `Content-Type: application/json` and must include a single resource object in JSON format as primary data.\n\nResponses include HTTP status codes that indicate whether the query was successful. If there was an error, a description explains the problem so that you can fix it and try again.\n\n## Authentication\nRequests to the Wowza Streaming Cloud REST API must be authenticated with two keys: an API key and an access key. Each key is a 64-character alphanumeric string that you can find on the **API Access** page in Wowza Streaming Cloud.\n\nUse the `wsc-api-key` and `wsc-access-key` headers to authenticate requests, like this (in cURL):\n\n```bash\ncurl -H 'wsc-api-key: [64-character-api-key-goes-here]' -H 'wsc-access-key: [64-character-access-key-goes-here]'\n```\n\n<!-- ReDoc-Inject: <security-definitions> -->\n\n## Version\nThe Wowza Streaming Cloud API is currently at version 1.0.0. Use `v1` in your base path in every request, like this path to the live_streams endpoint:\n```\nhttps://api.cloud.wowza.com/api/v1/live_streams\n```\n## Example query\nHere is a complete example POST request, in cURL, with proper JSON syntax, headers, authentication, and version information:\n```bash\ncurl -H 'wsc-api-key: [64-character-api-key-goes-here]' -H 'wsc-access-key: [64-character-access-key-goes-here]'\n  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST -d '{\n    \"live_stream\": {\n      \"name\": \"My live Stream\",\n      \"...\": \"...\"\n    }\n  }' https://api.cloud.wowza.com/api/v1/live_streams\n```\n",
