For a business account you use the default scope commerce.identity.readonly, which returns all the fields in the businessAccount container. These are returned because this is all public information. For an individual account, the fields returned in the individualAccount container are based on the scope you use. Using the default scope, only public information, such as eBay user ID, are returned. For details about what each scope returns, see the Identity API Overview.
