  "apiDescription": "SpaceTraders is an open-universe game and learning platform that offers a set of HTTP endpoints to control a fleet of ships and explore a multiplayer universe.\n\nThe API is documented using [OpenAPI](https://github.com/SpaceTradersAPI/api-docs). You can send your first request right here in your browser to check the status of the game server.\n\n```json http\n{\n  \"method\": \"GET\",\n  \"url\": \"https://api.spacetraders.io/v2\",\n}\n```\n\nUnlike a traditional game, SpaceTraders does not have a first-party client or app to play the game. Instead, you can use the API to build your own client, write a script to automate your ships, or try an app built by the community.\n\nWe have a [Discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/jh6zurdWk5) where you can share your projects, ask questions, and get help from other players.\n\n\n",
