  description: >
    This page contains documentation for Text Request's v3 API. [Click
    here](https://www.textrequest.com/api/v2) for v2 documentation.


    The Text Request API makes it easy to programmatically interact with your
    Text Request account. It provides the ability to **send messages**,
    **retrieve conversations**, **send payment requests**, **manage contacts,
    groups, dashboards, and users**, and **create and delete web hooks**. 


    Web hooks allow you to get notifications when **messages are sent**, **new
    messages are received**, **contacts are created**, **contacts are updated**,
    **payment requests are updated**, and when **location requests are
    received**.


    # Security


    All calls to the Text Request API will be authenticated with an API key. All
    API keys will be transmitted in the request **x-api-key** header. 
      
    ```

    x-api-key: 095E5113DE4142C28FB7815CC10BEB56

    ```
      
    Failure to specify an authorization header for any request will result in a
    HTTP `400 (Bad Request)` response.
      
    You can find your account's API key on your Text Request account:

    * Log into Text Request as an administrator

    * Click on the Integrations sidebar menu item

    * Choose the API tile near the top of the screen. If your account does not
    have api access, you can upgrade your account by clicking the "Buy Now"
    option on the API tile.

    * Copy your API Key from the box on-screen
      
    # Error Handling
      
      In the event of a failed request, the API will return an appropriate HTTP response code. If the error is due to an invalid request, a human readable error will also be returned is the response's *message* property. For blatantly obvious errors (`404 (Not Found)` responses, for example), this may be left blank. 
      
      Here's an example of an error response for an omitted field.
      
      ```
      HTTP 400
      
      Response Body
      
      {
        "status": 400,
        "errorCode": null,
        "message": "A first name must be specified."
      } 
      ```
      
      # Pagination for Returned Collections
      
      When querying a collection such as users or conversations, there may be thousands of results. To prevent responses from getting massively large, these collections are paginated. For any request to a resource that returns a collection, `page` and `page_size` querystring parameters may be specified to return a subset of entities.
      
      API endpoints that return a collection also include `meta` properties in the response, specifying **the returned page**, **the returned page size**, and **the total number of items in the collection**.
      
      Here's an example collection return, with the items represented by the ellipses (...):
      
      ```
      HTTP 200
      
      Response Body
      
      {
        "items": [
          ...
        ],
        "meta": {
            "page": 0,
            "page_size": 100,
            "total_items": 276
        }
      } 
      ```
      
      Here are the rules for how page, page_size, and link headers work:
      
      * If omitted, page = 0 and page_size = 100 is implied.
      * If page or page_size is invalid (negative number or non-numeric), a HTTP `400 (Bad Request)` response is returned.
      * If page * page_size is greater than the number of entities in the collection, the `items` array will be empty.
      * Collection `GET` requests will always return the `page`, `page_size`, and `total_items` properties.
      
      # Web hook Payloads

      Text Request has a variety of web hooks for hitting URLs you own if you want extra functionality in your own apps. Each webhook has a unique data payload that is sent whenever the trigger is set off. To see the payloads:
      * Scroll down to the `POST /dashboards/{dashboard_id}/hooks` API call on this page
      * Between the **Parameters** tab and the **Try it out** button, click the "Callbacks" tab
      * Click to view the payload sent in any of these web hooks. The payload will be the same regardless of whether it's a `POST`, `PUT`, or `DELETE` request.

      Web hooks can be created in the [web app](https://app.textrequest.com), or through the `POST` endpoint. Web hooks created by endpoints will not appear in the web app, but web hooks created in the web app will be seen by the `GET /dashboards/{dashboard_id}/hooks` api endpoint.

      Now that security and pagination are out of the way, lets take a look at the endpoints. You can try out each endpoint from directly within your browser by clicking the Authorize button below and entering your Text Request API key.

        Use this endpoint to post an MMS attachment to Text Request. If
        successful, mms details including a mms_id unique identifier will be
        returned. You can use this mms_id when sending MMS messages through the
        API. Valid file types are gif, jpeg, png, and mp4. The reason for first
        uploading an MMS attachment is for speed during reuse. If you are
        sending multiple messages, you can reuse a single uploaded MMS instead
        of re-uploading the same attachment multiple times.

      summary: Sends a message
      description: >
        Sends a message through a dashboard in your Text Request account. You
        can optionally specify a delivery status callback URL to track the
        status of the message on a third-party site. If a delivery callback URL
        is specified, you will receive either a delivered callback, or an error
        callback with a status code explaining the issue. Messages are sent at
        the throttle rate on your dashboard. The throttle rate is defined as
        your 10DLC message rate, or at one message per second for non-10dlc
        registered dashboards.


        Sent messages can also include Location requests. Location requests are
        urls sent in texts that contacts can access to send their location to
        Text Request. This info will be shown in their queue, but can also be
        sent via a callback to some third-party url.


        Location requests can be done in one of two ways:

        * Set geolocation_requested to true in the request body. This will add
        the phrase "Go to *\<text request url\>* to share your location"

        * Add the tag **[LocationRequest]** to your message body. This tag will
        be replaced by the text request url.


        Location requests can also have a callback that is returned when the
        location request is completed by the contact. This information will be
        sent as a POST request to the **location_callback** property. See the
        callbacks tab below for the schema of the callback.


        **WARNING:** The location_callback property only works with the
        **[LocationRequest]** tag. If no tag exsits, even if
        geolocation_requested is true, the callback will not work and the
        send-message request will return a `400 (Bad Request)` exception.

            was successfully delivered - it is possible for a valid message to
            be rejected and not delivered due to a number of factors such as an
            invalid recipient, the destination handset being switched off, or if
            the message is filtered as spam by the receiving carrier. For
            delivery confirmation, please add a valid webhook URL for the
            status_callback parameter.

      summary: Send a message to the contact with the given phone number
      description: >
        Sends a message (starting a new conversation if the given phone number
        has no message history). You can optionally specify a delivery status
        callback URL to track the status of the message on a third-party site.
        Upon successful execution, a message will be in a 'sent' status. If a
        delivery callback URL is specified, you will receive either a delivered
        callback, or an error callback with a status code explaining the issue.
        Messages are sent at the throttle rate on your dashboard. The throttle
        rate is defined as your 10DLC message rate, or at one message per second
        for non-10dlc registered dashboards.


        Sent messages can also include Location requests. Location requests are
        urls sent in texts that contacts can access to send their location to
        Text Request. This info will be shown in their queue, but can also be
        sent via a callback to some third-party url.


        Location requests can be done in one of two ways:

        * Set geolocation_requested to true in the request body. This will add
        the phrase "Go to *<text request url>* to share your location"

        * Add the tag **[LocationRequest]** to your message body. This tag will
        be replaced by the text request url.


        Location requests can also have a callback that is returned when the
        location request is completed by the contact. This information will be
        sent as a POST request to the **location_callback** property. See the
        callbacks tab below for the schema of the callback.


        **WARNING:** The location_callback property only works with the
        **[LocationRequest]** tag. If no tag exsits, even if
        geolocation_requested is true, the callback will not work and the
        send-message request will return a `400 (Bad Request)` exception.

        Archiving a conversation removes it from the results of all conversation
        retrieval endpoints. A conversation will be automatically unarchived if
        the customer sends a text to your Text Request number, or if you send
        the customer a text from your Text Request number. Archiving
        conversations is a good way to remove clutter from customers that you
        don’t plan on talking to in the future. Note that if a customer texts in
        "STOP"” to prevent you from sending them any further SMS messages, the
        conversation is automatically archived.
