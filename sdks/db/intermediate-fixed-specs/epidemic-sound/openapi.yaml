      summary: List collections with tracks
      description: >-
        The collections endpoint returns playlists curated by our team of
        in-house experts.


        We offer collections for any occasion: from holidays like “Día de
        Muertos“ to content types like “Real Estate” or “Badass ads”.


        You can manage the order and which collections are part or your
        applications’ free tier via the developer portal. As default, we return
        the collections included in your free tier first, followed by all
        collections in the Epidemic Sound library.


        Collections have attributes like title and cover art. In the few cases
        where we do not have cover art for a collection we return a default
        image.


        You can choose to return collections with or without tracks. The
        response will include a maximum of 20 tracks per collection. If a
        collection contains more than 20 tracks use endpoint
        '/collections/{collectionId}' to get all tracks.

        The download endpoint allows you to download an MP3 file of the track. 


        We offer MP3 files in two qualities; normal (128kbps) and high
        (320kbps).


        The high quality files can be used in content when needed, but normal
        quality is sufficient for most use cases. 


        The download links expire after 24 hours (normal quality) or 1 hour
        (high quality files). The expiration time is stated in the response. 


        All users can download the tracks that are part of the free tier. Only
        connected users with an active Epidemic Sound subscription can download
        tracks that are part of the premium library. If a user does not have
        access to download a track, you will get an error response. You can
        proactively mark premium tracks in your UI by using the track attribute
        `isPreviewOnly` (see track attributes).

      summary: Beats
      description: "  The beats endpoint provides information about the timestamps of beats in a track. You can use this endpoint to simplify the process to cut the video in sync with the music.\n\n  Unlike BPM which is a single number for the entire track, beats can change dynamically across a music piece. This is particularly valuable for capturing variations in tempo, such as a slower intro, a build-up with faster beats, or changes in rhythm throughout the composition.\n\n  The response includes two types of metadata:  `time` and `value`.\_\n\n  `time` represents the timestamp of the beat in milliseconds. `value` indicates the beat's position in a bar (or measure in the US), where 1 corresponds to the first beat (downbeat).\n\n  Examples:\n\n  Most pop songs have four beats in a bar. For example, if we looked at the beats data for Coolio’s `1, 2, 3, 4` it would look something like:\_ 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4\n\n  However, a waltz has three beats in a bar, and the data would look something like: 1-2-3, 1-2-3\n\n  Usage Scenarios:\n\n* Automatically cut a video in sync with the beat\n\n* Adding snap markers aligned with beat timestamps in the UI.

      summary: Preview track using cookies
      description: >-
        We recommend using HLS to allow users to play/preview a track. The main
        benefits of this compared to MP3 are smaller file transfers and
        alternate qualities, allowing the HLS client library to switch to a
        lower quality when necessary. 


        The audio is encoded using the AAC coding standard, which results in a
        smaller footprint for a similar quality compared to MP3. The primary
        manifest refers to two variant quality streams. HLS client libraries
        typically choose the optimal quality automatically, based on download
        speed.


        The format consists of audio files split into smaller chunks and
        manifests that refer to these audio files. Since the format is made up
        of multiple files, access to these are controlled using cookies.


        We provide an example app for iOS that plays HLS streams. Users do not
        need to connect their account or have an active Epidemic Sound
        subscription to play any track using HLS streaming. That allows your
        users to listen to all tracks before they connect their account.

      summary: Similar track segment based on trackID
      description: >-
        The similar segments endpoint allows developers to use part of a track
        as a reference to search for music segments in the Epidemic Sound
        catalog that sound similar.


        The feature utilizes the Epidemic Audio Reference (EAR) technology to
        provide users with the ability to quickly find alternative segments of
        music.


        Usage Scenarios:

          * Video Editing Templates: Replace default tracks in video templates with segments that fit better.
          * Quick Swaps: Swap out a segment of music in a video where the existing track doesn't quite match.
          * Creative Iteration: Easily experiment with different music segments to enhance your video's impact.

      description: >-
        We recommend using HLS to allow users to play/preview a track. The main
        benefits of this compared to MP3 are smaller file transfers and
        alternate qualities, allowing the HLS client library to switch to a
        lower quality when necessary. 


        The audio is encoded using the AAC coding standard, which results in a
        smaller footprint for a similar quality compared to MP3. The primary
        manifest refers to two variant quality streams. HLS client libraries
        typically choose the optimal quality automatically, based on download
        speed.


        The format consists of audio files split into smaller chunks and
        manifests that refer to these audio files.


        We provide an example app for iOS that plays HLS streams. Users do not
        need to connect their account or have an active Epidemic Sound
        subscription to play any track using HLS streaming. That allows your
        users to listen to all tracks before they connect their account.

        Powered by our 2 billion daily streams on YouTube, the highlights
        endpoint uses machine learning to recommend the best time section.


        You can use highlights to start playing the track from the right
        millisecond, or recommend the right part of the track for shorter
        content.


        The highlights endpoint provides start and stop timestamps in
        milliseconds. The default duration is 30 seconds.


        The endpoint accepts up to 5 different durations per request where each
        duration must be at least 5 seconds and at most 60 seconds.

        The download endpoint allows you to download an MP3 file of the sound

        We offer MP3 files in two qualities; normal (128kbps) and high
        (320kbps).


        The high quality files can be used in content when needed, but normal
        quality is sufficient for most use cases. 


        The download links expire after 24 hours (normal quality) or 1 hour
        (high quality files). The expiration time is stated in the response.
