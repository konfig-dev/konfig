        This endpoint requires and returns country-specific data. The exact
        required and returned fields will

        vary depending on which country the employment is in. To see the list of
        parameters for each country,

        see the **Show form schema** endpoint under the [Contract
        Amendments](https://gateway.remote.com/v1/docs/openapi.html) category.


        Please note that the compliance requirements for each country are
        subject to change according to local

        laws. Given its continual updates, using Remote's
        [json-schema-form](https://remote.com/resources/api/how-json-schemas-work)
        should be considered in order to avoid

        compliance issues and to have the latest version of a country
        requirements.


        If you are using this endpoint to build an integration, make sure you
        are dynamically collecting or

        displaying the latest parameters for each country by querying the _"Show
        form schema"_ endpoint.


        For more information on JSON Schemas, see the **How JSON Schemas work**
        documentation.


        To learn how you can dynamically generate forms to display in your UI,
        see the documentation for

        the
        [json-schema-form](https://remote.com/resources/api/how-json-schemas-work)
        tool.

        #### Automatically inviting an employee


        When you submit the `contract_details` and `pricing_plan_details`,
        Remote should have all the required data to automatically

        send an invite to the employee. You can tell if an automatic invite has
        been sent by looking at the `employment_lifecycle_stage`

        field value. If its value is `employee_self_enrollment`, it means the
        employee has received an email to join the Remote platform

        at their `personal_email`.


        After an automatic invite is sent to an employee, **you will not be able
        to update employment data through the Remote API**.

        After onboarding, only a limited set of employment data will be
        available for updates, such as `emergency_contact_details`.

        If you want to provide additional information for an employment, please
        make sure to do so **before** the employee is invited.

        We block updates to some employment data because employees need to agree
        to amendments in certain cases,

        such as when there are changes to their contract_details.

        Currently, these amendments can only be done through the Remote UI.


        Please contact Remote if you need to update contractors via API since
        it's currently not supported.

        [json-schema-form](https://remote.com/resources/api/how-json-schemas-work)
        should be considered in order to avoid

        compliance issues and to have the latest version of a country
        requirements.


        If you are using this endpoint to build an integration, make sure you
        are dynamically collecting or

        displaying the latest parameters for each country by querying the _"Show
        form schema"_ endpoint.


        For more information on JSON Schemas, see the **How JSON Schemas work**
        documentation.


        To learn how you can dynamically generate forms to display in your UI,
        see the documentation for

        tool.



        #### Automatically inviting an employee


        When you submit the `contract_details` and `pricing_plan_details`,
        Remote should have all the required data to automatically

        send an invite to the employee. You can tell if an automatic invite has
        been sent by looking at the `employment_lifecycle_stage`

        field value. If its value is `employee_self_enrollment`, it means the
        employee has received an email to join the Remote platform

        at their `personal_email`.


        After an automatic invite is sent to an employee, **you will not be able
        to update employment data through the Remote API**.

        After onboarding, only a limited set of employment data will be
        available for updates, such as `emergency_contact_details`.

        If you want to provide additional information for an employment, please
        make sure to do so **before** the employee is invited.

        We block updates to some employment data because employees need to agree
        to amendments in certain cases,

        such as when there are changes to their contract_details.

        Currently, these amendments can only be done through the Remote UI.


        Please contact Remote if you need to update contractors via API since
        it's currently not supported.

        Internally, Remote schedules upcoming incentives. As such, when you
        attempt to

        delete a recurring incentive, Remote will **ONLY** delete scheduled
        incentives

        with the `pending` status.


        Incentives payments that are already scheduled and cannot be deleted
        will be

        included in the response, in case you need to reference them.

          Creates a new company.

          ### Creating a company with only the required request body parameters
          When you call this endpoint and omit all the optional parameters in the request body,
          the following resources get created upon a successful response:
          * A new company with status `pending`.
          * A company owner for the new company with status `initiated`.

          See the [update a company endpoint](https://gateway.remote.com/v1/docs/openapi.html) for
          more details on how to get your company and its owner to `active` status.

          If you'd like to create a company and its owner with `active` status in a single request,
          please provide the optional `address_details` parameter as well.

          ### Accepting the Terms of Service

          A required step for creating a company in Remote is to accept our Terms of Service (ToS).

          Company managers need to be aware of our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy,
          hence **it's the responsibility of our partners to advise and ensure company managers read
          and accept the ToS**. The terms have to be accepted only once, before creating a company,
          and the Remote API will collect the acceptance timestamp as its confirmation.

          To ensure users read the most recent version of Remote's Terms of Service, their **acceptance
          must be done within the last fifteen minutes prior the company creation action**.

          To retrieve this information, partners can provide an element with any text and a description
          explaining that by performing that action they are accepting Remote's Term of Service. For
          instance, the partner can add a checkbox or a "Create Remote Account" button followed by a
          description saying "By creating an account, you agree to
          [Remote's Terms of Service](https://remote.com/terms-of-service). Also see Remote's
          [Privacy Policy](https://remote.com/privacy-policy)".
      parameters:
        - description: >
            Complementary action(s) to perform when creating a company:


            - `get_oauth_access_tokens` returns the user's access and refresh
            tokens

            - `send_create_password_email ` sends a reset password token to the
            company owner's email so they can log in using Remote UI (not needed
            if integration plans to use SSO only)


            If `action` contains `send_create_password_email` you can redirect
            the user to

        Check if a contract amendment request is automatable.

        If the contract amendment request is automatable, then after submission,
        it will instantly amend the employee's contract

        and send them an updated document.


        This endpoint requires and returns country-specific data. The exact
        required and returned fields will

        vary depending on which country the employment is in. To see the list of
        parameters for each country,

        see the **Show form schema** endpoint under the [Contract
        Amendments](https://gateway.remote.com/v1/docs/openapi.html) category.


        Please note that the compliance requirements for each country are
        subject to change according to local

        laws. Given its continual updates, using Remote's
        [json-schema-form](https://remote.com/resources/api/how-json-schemas-work)
        should be considered in order to avoid

        compliance issues and to have the latest version of a country
        requirements.


        If you are using this endpoint to build an integration, make sure you
        are dynamically collecting or

        displaying the latest parameters for each country by querying the _"Show
        form schema"_ endpoint.


        For more information on JSON Schemas, see the **How JSON Schemas work**
        documentation.


        To learn how you can dynamically generate forms to display in your UI,

        This endpoint is only available in Sandbox and allows creating
        employments which

        `provisional_start_date` is in the past. This is especially helpful for:
          * Testing the Timeoff Balance endpoints
          * Testing the Offboarding endpoints
          * Testing features around probation periods

        This endpoint will respond with a 404 outside of the Sandbox
        environment.

        ### Getting a company and its owner to `active` status

        If you created a company using the

        [create a company
        endpoint](https://gateway.remote.com/v1/docs/openapi.html) without all
        the required

        request body parameters, you can use this endpoint to provide the
        missing data. Once the company

        and its owner have all the necessary data, both their statuses will be
        set to `active` and the company

        onboarding will be marked as "completed".


        The following constitutes a company with "all the necessary data":

        * Complete `address`, with valid `address`, `postal_code`, `country` and
        `state` parameters (Varies by country. Use the

        [show form schema
        endpoint](https://gateway.remote.com/v1/docs/openapi.html) to see which
        address parameters

        are required).

        * Company `tax_number` or `registration_number` is not nil

        * Company `name` is not nil (already required when creating the company)

        * Company has a `desired_currency` in their bank account (already
        required when creating the company)

        * Company has accepted terms of service (already required when creating
        the company)

            The company status determines what a company is allowed to do:

            - `pending`: The company has been created and the company owner
            invited. Remote is waiting for the company owner to complete
            onboarding.

            - `review`: The company is under review. In rare occasions, a
            company may not automatically get created in `active` status because
            Remote needs to
              manually review the company that was created. The company will become `active` once the review is completed and no further action is necessary
              through the Remote API.
            - `active`: The company owner has completed onboarding and the
            company is ready to employ.

            - `archived`: The company is no longer active on the Remote platform
            and no changes can be made to the company.

        employee’s seniority.


        **Example**: Your employee started working for your company on Feb 1,
        2022.

        On Aug 1, 2022, you transferred the employee to Remote and started
        managing them on the platform.

        Feb 1, 2022 would be their seniority date. Aug 1, 2022 would be their
        starting date.
