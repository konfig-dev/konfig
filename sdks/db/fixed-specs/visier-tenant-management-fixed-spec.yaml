        You may need to update analytic tenants as they grow and as your
        organization upgrades the content available to
         them. You may also encounter a scenario where an analytic tenant transitions across different industries.

         To ensure that the analytic tenant receives accurate benchmarks and predictive functionality, update their
         industry code in the Visier system.

         You can use this API to update any field on an analytic tenant, except tenantCode.

      description: |-
        Warning! Deprovisioning an analytic tenant is not reversible.
         Before deprovisioning, you must disable an analytic tenant. For more information, see **`/v1/admin/tenants/:tenantId/disable`**.

         This API removes an analytic tenant permanently from the Visier system. If you are unsure whether an analytic tenant
         may be re-enabled on any of the Visier modules at any time, you may instead want to disable the analytic tenant.

         If successful, the response returns the status "Deprovisioned". This indicates that the tenant is scheduled for
         deprovisioning, which may take several days to complete.

            The unique ID of the analysis to display for this tenant when a user

             Retrieve the ID by opening an analysis in the production version of a tenant and copying the string after the last forward slash (/) in the URL. For example: https://jupiter.visier.com/hr/prod/appcontainer?previewId=-eZPm8xvo3SUMpD4Q5pdE-6mCj9CQ9K699XgqRGwtOxagH5x2IzDFawlWn3hYqFEfU7nP0YK9ASEzmrNfAihGg..&previewType=Production#/analytics/myanalyses/8a4c1d4f-eb61-4da0-9e5b-55bef757c30e.
             The `homeAnalysisID` is 8a4c1d4f-eb61-4da0-9e5b-55bef757c30e.

             Alternatively, retrieve the ID by copying the `contentId` found by following the `Embed a visualization` documentation.
