        By default, Terminal will sync all connections where `syncMode =
        automatic` on a regular cadence. For customers that may not need a
        fleet's data to be kept up to date and want to reduce their active
        tracked trucks, you can set `syncMode = manual` and invoke this endpoint
        when you want to sync data.


        If you're wondering if this is relevent to your use case then feel free
        to reach out and we'd be happy to assist.

        _Note:_


        Given the large volume of location data available, we encourage
        customers to accept compressed (`gzip`) responses in order to maximize
        throughput. This is supported with many popular HTTP clients. Result
        limits vary depending on if results are compressed or not.
