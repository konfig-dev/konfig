      A consumer-permissioned data workflow is initiated and defined by the Data
      Request resource.   A Data Request specifies or bind together the various
      elements of a consumer-permissioned data workflow, in particular: the
      Individual, the type of data requested, the reports to be generated, the
      Link experience, optional Individual communication and messaging.   The
      consumer experience powered by [MeasureOne
      Link](https://docs.measureone.com) is specified by the required
      `datarequest_id`. MeasureOne supports multiple types of data requests
      catering to different use cases. All services accept `datarequest_id` as a
      reference.

      Items are the resource representing data shared by Individuals with
      MeasureOne.   The underlying document of an Item is called *source data* 
      These can be college transcripts, pay stubs, real estate titles, etc.  
      Items are stored and information from them can be retrieved through the
      Service API calls.   The information in an Item is shared through the
      Service APIs according to the consumer permission.   Importantly, note
      that unless permissioned by the Individual, the Item data may not be
      shared directly with you.

      </div>


      MeasureOne offers a framework for initiating the consumer-permissioned
      data exchange using automatically generated invitations.    These
      invitations contain unique links that refer the user back to the
      MeasureOne hosted portal in a personalized manner to initiate and complete
      the consumer-permissioned data exchange.     These API endpoints provide a
      programmatic interface to this framework.   Note that a zero code
      alternative to a programmatic implementation is to use the MeasureOne
      Customer Dashboard to interface with the Invitations framework.

      MeasureOne authenticates your API requests using access tokens. If you do
      not include the `access_token` when making a request, MeasureOne returns
      an authentication error. 

      To gain access to the MeasureOne API, reach out to us on
      sales@measureone.com. Once you’ve completed the signup process, we’ll
      provide a live `client_id` & `secret` for use in our API.


      You can access our APIs using Access Tokens Or Public Tokens. The Public
      Tokens are short lived with limited scope while Access Tokens are long
      lived. 


      ## Access Tokens

      Access Tokens are long-lived tokens that give you access to the MeasureOne
      infrastructure for your account. 

        **Access tokens should be used only from your own server side applications.**



      ## Public Tokens


      Public tokens are short-lived tokens with defined `scope` and `policy`. 

      The scope indicates the resources and endpoints you can access using these
      tokens while policy indicates the data you can access using the APIs.


      MeasureOne APIs will return a 401 error if the public token is used for
      scope or policy that is different from the token's scope and policy.


      **For example**, if you create a public token for policy having
      **individual_id** `idv_293241AAjy2EZt3R` and if you try to invoke
      /individuals/get_by_id for another individual, it will return a 401 error.


      The table below defines the currently supported scope.

      The Individual is a core resource that represents your user.   At the
      start of the workflow an Individual representing the user must be
      created.   Retrieved Items are associated with the Individual.    Almost
      all Service APIs take the Individual ID as a reference.
    name: Individuals
  - name: Income & Employment
  - description: >

      <a id='datasources'></a> Data Sources are online locations of Items.  
      Individuals (your users) connect Data Sources and provide MeasureOne with
      their credentials and consent so that MeasureOne may retrieve Items (their
      data) from the Data Source to be subsequently shared with you in a
      strictly permissioned way.    


      Data Sources may be universities, financial institutions, payroll systems,
      government records.    MeasureOne curates the list of Data Sources to
      ensure the provenance of the retrieved documents.   Since not all Data
      Sources may be relevant to your application, the API allows you to
      configure and select the list of Data Sources that are displayed to your
      user.

      MeasureOne offers a secure, API-based platform to power
      consumer-permissioned data sharing,  providing a safe and transparent way
      for consumers to share data with third-party applications.


      The MeasureOne platform acts as a bridge between data sources containing
      the consumer's personal data and data recipients.  Data sources are online
      systems that house the data to be shared and that are accessible to the
      consumer.   Example data sources are academic institutions, payroll
      processors, utility providers government systems and others.  Data
      recipients are any third-party that the consumer wishes to share
      information with, often in return for a product or service that the data
      recipient is offering.   Example recipients are lenders, marketeers,
      background check companies, employers,  recruiters, and others.


      The MeasureOne API allows you as a data recipient to integrate
      consumer-permissioned data into your workflows.   It does so by
      facilitating consent, access, acquisition, and delivery of your users'
      permissioned data.    In the basic workflow of consumer-permissioned
      sharing is as follows.   First, your users provide their consent to
      Measure one to share specific personal information with you.  They then
      share their credentials with MeasureOne providing access to data -- called
      "source data" -- that provides the information that they have consented to
      share with you.  MeasureOne uses these credentials to connect that data
      source to its platform, access and acquire the source data.    MeasureOne
      then provides access to this source data through a set of service APIs.   


      There are several benefits to using the MeasureOne API.   Our API hides
      the complexity involved in the consumer-permissioning workflow behind a
      simple straighforward API so that you can focus on your application and
      customer experience.    We handle user credentials so you don't have to. 
      We handle consents from the user and ensure that you only receive access
      to the consented information, freeing you from the need to worry about
      accessing consumer information improperly.   We also provide guarantees to
      your user that we will not share information outside the scope of their
      consent.    This provides you with the opportunity to have your users
      share information with you that otherwise would not be accessible. 
      Finally,  MeasureOne ensures the provenance of the shared data.   The data
      is shared by the user, with their explicit consent, but without any
      ability to modify or tamper with it.


      The current 3.0 version is not backward compatible with version 2.0.   If
      you are a 2.0 user, please see our [Migration
      Guide](https://docs.measureone.com).
    name: Introduction
  - description: >

      This section gives you some brief use cases for using the API in your
      workflow. For complete details, please see the full documentation. 



      ### Income or Employment Verification


      Extracting income information from paystubs, 1099 or other income-related
      documents provides you with a comprehensive solution to assessing your
      user's income.



      ### Home and Auto Insurance Policy Verification or Quoting


      By facilitating the sharing of home and auto insurance policies,
      MeasureOne enables customers to verify insurance information during auto
      and home transactions or provide detailed policy information for
      comparative quoting purposes.



      ### Academic qualification, history or enrollment status assessment


      MeasureOne supports acquisition and processing of academic documents.  By
      connecting the user's academic institution to our platform, MeasureOne
      uses the shared transcripts and other educational data to provide an
      assessment or verification of educational data.  This includes  academic
      history, degree verification, student enrollment status or other similar
      data.   



      ### Identity and Fraud Detection


      By leveraging multiple items of consumer-permissioned data, MeasureOne
      provides unique opportunities to customers to establish identity and
      protect against fraud.



      ### Alternative Data Financial Underwriting

        MeasureOne's MeritScore is a proprietary predictive analytic that correlates credit performance with academic data.    Using consumer-permissioned transcripts, MeasureOne provides a score that correlates the user's academic performance to credit default risk.   This both reduces risk for the lender while opening up new credit opportunities for young borrowers.
    name: Sample Use cases
  - description: >

      MeasureOne has four core resources. These resources help you seamlessly
      integrate consumer-permissioned-data workflow into your applications. 


      ### Individual


      The Individual is your end user/consumer whom you are requesting to share
      data or information with you as part of your application.   In a typical
      implementation, ths Individual is directed to MeasureOne through an
      invitation initiated from your application or the MeasureOne Dashboard.  
      MeasureOne then interacts with the Individual to complete the
      consumers-permissioned data sharing workflow and shares the accessed
      Individual data with you, either directly with your application or through
      the MeasureOne Dashboard. 


      ### Data Requests


      A consumer-permissioned data workflow is initiated and defined by the Data
      Request resource.   A Data Request specifies or bind together the various
      elements of a consumer-permissioned data workflow, in particular: the
      Individual, the type of data requested, the reports to be generated, the
      Link experience, optional Individual communication and messaging.   

        The following table specifies the supported Data Request types.   Based on the Data Request type, MeasureOne tailors the consumer-permissioned 
        workflow to satisfy the indicated request for data.   

        | Data Request Type | Description                                             | 
        |-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------
        | ACADEMIC_SUMMARY  | Request the education summary of the Individual
        | ENROLLMENT_STATUS | Request the enrollment status of the Individual
        | EMPLOYMENT_SUMMARY| Request the employment summary of the Individual
        | INCOME_SUMMARY    | Request the income summary for the Individual
        | INCOME_EMPLOYMENT_DETAILS | Request the VOIE details of the Individual
        | HOME_INSURANCE_DETAILS | Request the Home insurance details of the individuals
        | AUTO_INSURANCE_DETAILS | Request the Auto insurance details of the individuals
        | REALIZED_GAINS    | Request 1099-B information from the Individual's brokerage account

      ### Items 

        Individuals permission access to documents online for your stated business purpose.   The permissioned documents that MeasureOne accesses and acquires are called *Items*.   Items can be in any format -- HTML, PDF, XML, JSON, etc.   Once the Item is acquired, it is parsed stored.  To enforce the permissions on the Item data,  access to the information in the Items is available solely through [Service APIs](https://docs.measureone.com).    This separation of the Item data from the Service APIs limits the scope of information to just what the Individual has authorized to share, independent of the underlying Item data used to generate it.   This ensures that you receive only the permissioned data and that the Individual's privacy is protected.


      ### Datasources

        The online location of Items is called a *Data Source*.  Data Sources are typically online accounts that are owned by the Individual.   The Individual gives explicit consent to MeasureOne to access their Data Source account and retrieve the Items necessary to fulfill your Data Request.

    name: how_it_works
    x-displayName: How it works
  - description: >
      The current major version of the MeasureOne API is 3.0, and is passed in
      the API path as a `/v3` prefix.   The current 3.0 API version is
      `20210117` and is passed as a request header while calling the API. If no
      version number is specified in the request header, the API will default to
      the version that was live when you first signed up for MeasureOne API
      keys. 

      We periodically release changes to our APIs. While we try to remain
      backward compatible, changes in our API may result in changes to the data
      or schema structures exposed in the current version.

      ### Protocols & Header Parameters

      Unless specified otherwise, the MeasureOne API uses POST requests to
      communicate and HTTP [response codes](https://docs.measureone.com) to
      indicate status and errors. Unless explicitly specified, all responses
      come in standard JSON, and all requests must include a Content-Type of
      `application/json` with a valid JSON body.

      Many of MeasureOne APIs are asynchronous in nature. Client applications
      integrating MeasureOne API are required to expose endpoints for MeasureOne
      to send the [Webhook Notifications](https://docs.measureone.com).

      The diagram below depicts how the asynchronous communication will work. 
      APIs having Asynchronous communication may also send a synchronous
      response if the response is readily available.

      MeasureOne Link is a front-end component that provides you all the
      capabilities necessary to initiate the the consumer-permissioning workflow
      for your users.  It enables your users to permit your application to
      access their data in a consumer-permissioned manner.



      Link handles the consent, the data source identification, the credential
      collection, and the integration with the MeasureOne platform to access and
      acquire the consumer-permissioned data. It handles a variety of
      authentication mechanisms including multi-factor authentication and offers
      various configuration options to tailor the UI to your application. 


      As an alternative to the embedded widget, MeasureOne supports hosted
      solutions of Link, providing no-code options for your integrations. 
      Please login to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.measureone.com) for more
      details.

      Integration of Link is done using a small snippet of javascript that can
      be displayed in any part of your application. 


      Widget integration requires the `m1-link` tag and a set of [configuration
      options](https://docs.measureone.com) as shown in the sample configuration
      JSON.


      Link raises [events](https://docs.measureone.com) for various user actions
      that your application can subscribe to. In addition to these events, the
      MeasureOne platform communicates with the client application via
      [webhooks](https://docs.measureone.com).

      ## Overview

      Version 3.0 of the MeasureOne API introduced many new features and
      capabilites.   Unfortunately, it is not backward compatible with v2.0.  
      This guide will walk you through the backward incompatible changes that
      you need to be aware of while migrating to 3.0



      ### Endpoint Migration

      The changes in URL will be applicable if you are using the following
      endpoints


      |V2.0|V3.0|

      |----------|----------|

      | /individual/get_academic_summary |/services/get_academic_summary

      | /individual/get_enrollment_status |/services/get_enrollment_status

      | /transcripts/new |/items/new

      | /schools/get |/datasources/get

      | /transcripts/new | /items/new

      | /transcripts/get_by_id | /items/get_by_id

      | /transcripts/get_files | /items/get_files

      | /analytics/meritscore | /services/meritscore

      | /analytics/gradscore | /services/gradscore



      ### Payload Changes

      This section depicts the changes you may have to do in your 

      #### Get Academic Summary


      `individual.datasource_id` has now changed to `individual.datasources`.
      You can now pass multiple datasource_ids to get the academic_summary


      ```json


      {
          "individual": {
          "individual_id": "idv_Cevp4Jw9CIsEeNjpgAAjy2EZt3R",
          "datasources": ["sch_CaIGVqBRRpETI6fkCyUSpNHbHFo", "sch_CaIGVqBRRpETI6fkCyUS233fbHFo"] // changes in 3.0
          }   
      }


      ```


      #### Get Enrollment Status


      `individual.datasource_id` has now changed to `individual.datasources`.
      You can now pass multiple datasource_ids to get the academic_summary


      ```json


      {
          "individual": {
          "individual_id": "idv_Cevp4Jw9CIsEeNjpgAAjy2EZt3R",
          "datasources": ["sch_CaIGVqBRRpETI6fkCyUSpNHbHFo", "sch_CaIGVqBRRpETI6fkCyUS233fbHFo"] // changes in 3.0
          }   
      }


      ```

      #### Creating a new item


      `source_data_type` has should now be at the top of the payload.


      ```json


      {
        "external_id": "ABCDECD",
        "individual_id": "idv_Cevp4Jw9CIsEeNjpgAAjy2EZt3R",
        "source_data_type": "M1_DIGEST", // changes in 3.0
        "source_data": [
          {
            "referrer": "USER",
            "source_data_value": {
              "degree_type": "BACHELORS",
              "years_in_school": 2,
              "min_grade": "D",
              "cgpa": 3.3,
              "last_term_gpa": 3.5,
              "credits_earned": 65
            }
          }
        ]
      }


      ```

      <br>


      ### Migrating to Data Requests

      A consumer-permissioned data workflow is initiated and defined by the Data
      Request resource. A Data Request specifies or binds together the various
      elements of a consumer-permissioned data workflow, in particular: the
      Individual, the type of data requested, the reports to be generated, the
      Link experience, optional Individual communication, and messaging.

      Migrating to Data Request is an important step required to leverage all
      the features of MeasureOne

      If you are using v3 of MeasureOne, and not using Data Requests, the
      following are the steps you should take.

      - After <a
      href="#tag/Individuals/paths/~1v3~1individuals~1new/post">creating the
      Individual</a>, create a new Data Request using this <a
      href="#tag/Data-Requests/paths/~1v3~1datarequests~1new/post">endpoint</a>

      - Once the Data Request is created, pass the `datarequest_id` in the <a
      href="#tag/Configuration">Link Configuration</a> in the Widget

      - Subscribe to webhooks - <a
      href="#tag/webhooks/paths/datarequest.updates_available/post">datarequest.updates_available</a>
      and <a
      href="#tag/webhooks/paths/datarequest.acquisition_complete/post">datarequest.acquisition_complete</a>
      to receive updates

      - On receiving the webhooks, you can now call our <a
      href="http://localhost:8080/#tag/Education/paths/~1v3~1services~1get_academic_summary/post">Service
      APIs</a> as you do in the existing integration.

      - You can also pass `datarequest_id` in the service call to get data
      pertaining to the data request.

        ### Usage options 
          The usage of `/v3/items/new` varies depending on its intended use and availability of information. The request payload must include either a `source_data_value` object **OR** a `source_data_reference` object. Passing both as a part of the payload may result in processing errors.

          #### Using Source Data Object
          If the attribute values for a transcript are known, send the source data inline in the request using the `source_data_value` object. 

          #### Using Source Data Reference Object

          If the data is in a document, upload it using the [`/items/upload`](https://docs.measureone.com) endpoint or make it available at a remote location. A reference to the uploaded document should then be included in the request using the `source_data_reference` object.

      description: >
        Retrieves an existing Item data. The endpoint can be used once the
        `processing_status` for an Item is `COMPLETED`. It will return Item data
        in its response payload. If the processing of the Item is not yet
        complete, it will return the current status of the Item. This API is
        [asynchronous](https://docs.measureone.com). 


        The optional `data_confidence` object, if present, lists data attributes
        whose extraction accuracy was lower than 95%. Such a scenario can come
        up when processing images or other unstructured source data items. The
        attributes are specified as a json path within the corresponding data
        object. In the event that the `data_confidence` object is not present
        (i.e., null), the data extraction should be considered 100% accurate.
