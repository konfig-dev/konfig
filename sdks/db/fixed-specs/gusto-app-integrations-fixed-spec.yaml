        ### Overview

        The company provisioning API provides a way to create a Gusto company as
        part of your integration. When you successfully call the API, the API
        does the following:

        * Creates a new company in Gusto.

        * Creates a new user in Gusto.

        * Makes the new user the primary payroll administrator of the new
        company.

        * Sends a welcome email to the new user.

        In the response, you will receive an account claim URL. Redirect the
        user to this URL to complete their account setup inside of Gusto

        Pay periods are the foundation of payroll. Compensation, time &
        attendance, taxes, and expense reports all rely on when they happened.
        To begin submitting information for a given payroll, we need to agree on
        the time period.


        By default, this endpoint returns pay periods starting from 6 months ago
        to the date today.  Use the `start_date` and `end_date` parameters to
        change the scope of the response.  End dates can be up to 3 months in
        the future and there is no limit on start dates.


        Starting in version '2023-04-01', the eligible_employees attribute was
        removed from the response.  The eligible employees for a payroll are

        payrolls#prepare endpoint.

        Jobs may have many compensations, but only one that is active. The

        By default the API returns only the current compensation - see the
        `include` query parameter for retrieving all compensations.


        Note: Currently the API does not support creating multiple compensations
        per job - creating a compensation with the same `job_uuid` as another
        will fail with a relevant error.


        Use `flsa_status` to determine if an employee is eligible for overtime.

        #### Default Earning Type

        Certain earning types are special because they have tax considerations.
        Those earning types are mostly the same for every company depending on
        its legal structure (LLC, Corporation, etc.)


        #### Custom Earning Type

        Custom earning types are all the other earning types added specifically
        for a company.

            The mask is a sequence of characters representing the requirements

            - any other character represents the literal character


            Examples:

            - mask: `WHT-######` represents `WHT-` followed by 5 digits, e.g.
            `WHT-33421`
