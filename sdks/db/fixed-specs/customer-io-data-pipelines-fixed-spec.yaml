  description: >
    This is a reference for the Data Pipelines API. In general, you'll consume
    this API through one of our source libraries—our JavaScript client library
    or any of our server packages. But you can also integrate directly with our
    REST API if you don't want to install one of our libraries or you want to
    support a source that we don't have a native integration with.


    **All endpoints begin with: `https://cdp.customer.io/v1`**

    # API region


    We host services in the United States (US) and European Union (EU, host
    subdomains are suffixed with `-eu`). Select the appropriate region for
    server addresses that apply to your region. 


    If you're in our EU region, you'll need to specify the EU URL when you
    initialize our server-side libraries. If you use our JavaScript client
    library, we'll set your region and route data/calls automatically.


    # Set up a REST API source


    After you add a Rest API source, you'll use endpoints at
    `https://cdp.customer.io/v1/{method}`


    1. Go to the <svg class="icon"><use href="#connection" /></svg> tab and
    click **Sources**.

    1. Click **Add Source**, pick **HTTP**, and click **Next**.

    1. Give the source a *Name* and copy your *API Key*. You'll use this key to
    authenticate with our API. If you don't copy the key now, you can always get
    it later from the *Settings* tab when you're done setting up your source. 

    1. (Optional) Test your connection by sending a test call. You can copy your
    API key into an app like Postman or send a CURL request. If your request is
    successful, and then you click *Test Connection* we'll let you know if your
    request was successful and you've set up your HTTP implementation
    successfully.

    1. Click **Submit**.
      
    Now you can connect your REST API source to destinations.


    # Try out our postman collection


    We've generated a Postman collection with all of the endpoints organized as
    you'll find them on this page, with a starter environment (mainly to contain
    your API key). For our API endpoints, **your API key is your username and
    your password is blank**.


    You'll notice that payloads on this page can contain significantly more
    information than the payloads that appear in our collection. We've limited
    our collections to the fields that you'll _typically_ use when you send
    calls to our APIs and libraries, so it's easier to get started. But you can
    add additional fields to payloads—like `context`, `integrations`, and so
    on—if you want.


    If you fork this collection, you might want to disable the *Watch original
    collection* option. We automatically update our Postman collection whenever
    we release changes to our documentation, even if we don't change our
    APIs—which happens daily! Rather than being flooded with Postman
    notifications, you can check out our [Release
    Notes](https://customer.io/docs/api/cdp/) for updates to our APIs.

    # Authentication 


    Our API uses basic authorization with an API Key provided when you set up a
    source. If you use Postman or another platform that helps you send API
    calls, this API key is the *Username*, and the *Password* is blank.


    Our sources are all authenticated using a **API Key** that we generate when
    you create a source.


    <SecurityDefinitions />


    # API limits


    A request is limited to 32KB. A batch request is limited to 500KB total and
    32KB per call in the request. If a request exceeds these limits, you will
    receive a 200 response, but the request will not go through.


    # Backfilling data


    By default, Customer.io records a `timestamp` when we receive requests. If
    you're sending data to Customer.io in real time, you don't need to worry
    about the timestamp.


    If you want to backfill requests, you can send a `timestamp`—an ISO 8601
    date-time string—telling us when the request occurred. This provides a way
    to log `track` and `page` calls when the activities _actually_ took place. 


    # Schemas


    You only need to populate a few fields when you send data to Customer.io.
    Our JavaScript client and server libraries populate additional information
    for each call, which you'll see when you look at individual events in
    Customer.io.


    The information below shows the complete list of information reported to
    Customer.io with each event. 


    See the endpoints below this section for the much smaller list of fields
    you'll actually set when you invoke methods in our client and server-side
    libraries.


    ## Identify Schema


    When you send an identify call, you'll typically include a `userId` and
    `traits`. Most other fields are populated by Customer.io—either by a source
    library or our servers.


    If you provide an `anonymousId`, we'll attribute traits to an anonymous
    user. If you provide both an `anonymousId` and `userId`, we'll associate
    anonymous activity to the `userId`.


    Traits are the same as *Attributes* in Customer.io. If Customer.io Messaging
    is your destination, you'll see that traits map 1-to-1 with attributes. But
    not all systems call the things you know about people `traits` or
    `attributes`. You'll need to check with your destination to understand what
    your destination calls people-data!


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/identify" />


    ## Track Schema


    When you send a track call, you'll typically include the event name and
    additional properties you want to track. You can provide either an
    `anonymousId` or a `userId`. If you provide both, we attribute the activity
    to the `userId` and ignore the `anonymousId`.


    Most other fields are populated by Customer.io—either by a source library or
    our servers.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/track" />


    ## Page Schema


    A `page` call represents a pageview.


    Page events are automatically sent whenever you load our JavaScript library,
    which is typically every page. Customer.io automatically gathers the page
    name and URL, but you can pass additional properties, like the `category`. 


    Most other fields are populated by Customer.io—either by a source library or
    our servers.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/page" />


    ## Screen Schema


    A `scren` call indicates that someone went to a screen in your mobile app.


    We don't have mobile libraries supporting the `screen` method just yet, but
    we'll still accept calls with `type: "screen"` if you want to set up your
    own calls.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/screen" />


    ## Group Schema


    Group events assign the identified person to a group. You'll typically pass
    the `groupId` that you want to associate a person with, and any `traits`
    that you want to assign to the group.


    Most other fields are populated by Customer.io—either by a source library or
    our servers.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/group" />


    ## Common fields


    These are the fields that we augment incoming data with. The shape of this
    data may change depending on the type of call you make (identify, track,
    etc), and the source medium (client side javascript, mobile library, etc).
    We collect many of these values automatically, though you can override some
    of them. See individual methods below for information about which fields are
    accepted in requests.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/all_common_fields" />


    ## The Context object


    These are fields that we collect automatically with requests—context for the
    request—but you can override these values.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/context" />


    # Customer.io semantic event schemas


    ```javascript

    analytics.track("Device Created or Updated", {
      device: {
        token: "string",
        type: "ios"
      }
    });

    ```


    Journeys, our messaging automation tool, supports a number of actions that
    aren't immediately apparent from the API. For example, I can add a person
    using the `identify` function, but what if I want to remove a person? 


    That's what semantic events are for: they let you send `track` calls with a
    specific event name and payload to perform actions in Journeys. In general,
    the event names map directly to the thing you want to do: like `Create
    Device` or `Delete Person`.


    ## Delete person


    Remove a person from your Customer.io environment. You might do this when
    someone cancels their subscription with you or otherwise leaves your
    service.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/delete_person" />


    ## Create or Update a Device


    Add or update a device. If a device (represented by the
    `context.device.token`) exists, does not exist, we'll create it. If the
    device token already exists, we'll update the it.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/create_update_device" />


    ## Delete a Device


    Delete a device. You might do this when someone logs out of your app or
    otherwise removes a device.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/delete_device" />


    ## Delete a relationship


    Remove a relationship between a person and an object in Customer.io. This is
    basically the opposite of a `group` operation. Where objects represent
    things like accounts, companies, or online classes, you might delete a
    relationship when a person is no longer on an account, leaves a company, or
    drops a class.


    This event requires a `groupId` and an `objectTypeId`. If you don't provide
    an `objectTypeId`, we'll assume it's `1`, but if the `groupId` with the
    associated objectTypeId` (defaulting to 1) does not exist, the event will
    _not_ remove a person from the group.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/relationship_deleted" />


    ## Delete a group (object)


    Remove a group (also called an "object") from Customer.io Journeys.
    Groups/objects represent things like accounts, companies, and online
    classes—non-people entities that people can be related to. You might delete
    a group when an account is closed, a company is acquired, or you stop
    offering a class.


    This event requires a `groupId` and an `objectTypeId`. If you don't provide
    an `objectTypeId`, we'll assume it's `1`, but if the `groupId` with the
    associated `objectTypeId` (defaulting to 1) does not exist, the event will
    _not_ find and delete the `groupId`.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/group_deleted" />


    ## Suppress a person


    Remove a person from your Customer.io workspace _and_ prevent them from
    being added back to your workspace using the same identifier. In general you
    should **only send this event for compliance reasons**, like when someone
    invokes their right to be forgotten in accordance with GDPR or CAN-SPAM
    regulations.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/suppress_person" />


    ## Unsuppress a person


    Allow a userId to be added back to your Customer.io workspace. This does not
    restore information from a person you previously suppressed. It only allows
    you to add a person back to your workspace using the same identifier.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/unsuppress_person" />


    ## Report a message delivery


    Reports delivery events for messages. In general, we use this event with our
    JavaScript snippet to report delivery events for in-app messages back to
    your Customer.io workspace.


    While Customer.io knows about messages that are sent, we use this event to
    determine when an in-app message is delivered, clicked, and so on. Each
    message contains a unique `deliveryId` that we trace back to the person,
    campaign/broadcast, and other items in your Customer.io workspace. 


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/report_delivery_event" />


    # A/B test event schemas

     ```javascript
    analytics.track('Experiment Viewed', {
      experiment_id: "12345",
      experiment_name: "Homepage Hero",
      variant_id: "67890",
      variant_name: "Hero B"
    })

    ```

    If you `track` A/B tests, we recommend that you use the event name
    `Experiment Viewed` and `properties` listed below. Sending uniform events
    that conform to the schema defined here helps ensure that you can use any
    default actions that we set up for destinations that rely on A/B test
    events—now or with destinations we add in the future.


    <div style="height: 140px;"></div>


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/experiment_viewed" />


    # Ecommerce event schemas

     ```javascript
    analytics.track('Product Viewed', {
      product_id: "coolshoes-123"
      sku: "abc-123-xyz"
      category: "shoes"
      name: "Cool Shoes"
      brand: "A Shoe Brand"
      variant: "red"
      price: 139.99
      quantity: 1
      coupon: "NEWUSER20"
      position: 3
      url: "https://www.example.com/product/123"
      image_url: "https://www.example.com/product/123.jpg"
      currency: "USD"
      value: 119.99
    })

    ```


    We've defined a set of `track` events that you can use to send ecommerce
    activity from your sources. Our default actions and data structures assume
    that you send ecommerce events in the shapes below. [Learn more about our
    ecommerce specification](https://customer.io/docs/api/cdp/).


    If you send an event with a matching name and structure defined below (where
    the schemas below represents the `properties` object), destinations that
    rely on ecommerce events (like "ad" destinations) will already be set up
    with actions to handle your ecommerce source events. For example, sending
    the following `Product Viewed` event would automatically trigger an action
    in most of our "ad" destinations and handle all the fields in the event.


    **The title of each schema below is the name of the event you should pass in
    a `track` call**. 


    While you can map ecommerce events however you want, we recommend that you
    use the events below to take advantage of our default actions and data
    structures. These events make it easy to send uniform data through data
    pipelines to your destinations.


    <div style="height: 140px;"></div>

        ]
    )

    ```


    These events represent your users' activities in your app—like when they
    open, close, or update your app. If you use our iOS 3.x SDK or later, we
    automatically track a number of these events for you. Later versions of our
    other mobile SDKs will support the same events as our iOS 3.x SDK.


    ## Application Installed


    Our CDP-enabled SDKs send this event the *first* time a user opens your
    application. If the user never opens your app, we won't be able to collect
    this event. This event doesn't wait for the SDK to capture attribution or
    campaign information, and is collected automatically. Destinations like
    Facebook and Google require discrete install events to correctly attribute
    installs to ads served through their platforms.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/app_installed" />


    ## Application Opened


    Our CDP-enabled SDKs send this event when a user launches or foregrounds
    your mobile application—after the first open. The first open results in an
    `Application Installed` event, so we only send this event on subsequent
    opens. Like the `Application Installed` event, this event also does not wait
    for the SDK to capture attribution information but it _can_ include
    information about referring applications or deep link URLs if available when
    the app opens.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/app_opened" />


    ## Application Backgrounded


    Send this event when a user backgrounds the application upon
    [`applicationDidEnterBackground`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622997-applicationdidenterbackground). 


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/app_backgrounded" />


    ## Application Foregrounded


    Send this event when your audience returns to your app after previously
    backgrounding it. This event is distinct from `Application Opened` in that
    the app is considered opened already, even if it's in the background. 


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/app_foregrounded" />


    ## Application Updated


    Send this event when the user opens your app _after_ updating your app. Our
    iOS 3.x SDK automatically collects this event rather than the "Application
    Opened" event after someone updates your app.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/app_updated" />


    ## Application Uninstalled


    You can send this event when a user uninstalls your app. Like similar events
    that happen outside of your app itself, our CDP-enabled SDKs cannot capture
    this event automatically.


    However, some direct-mode destinations detect this for you using silent push
    notifications through their own SDKs. You might also be able to send these
    events to Customer.io using callbacks. 


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/app_uninstalled" />


    ## Application Crashed


    You can send this event when you receive a crash notification from your app,
    but it is not meant to supplant traditional crash reporting tools. By
    tracking crashes this way, you can analyze which types of users are impacted
    by crashes and how those crashes affect their engagement. You may also want
    to send messages to users who experience crashes through other messaging
    channels. 


    Like similar events that happen outside of your app itself, our CDP-enabled
    SDKs cannot capture this event automatically. But you might be able to
    capture this kind of event with a callback or a webhook.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/app_crashed" />


    # Video events


    ```javascript

    analytics.track('Experiment Viewed', {
      experiment_id: "12345",
      experiment_name: "Homepage Hero",
      variant_id: "67890",
      variant_name: "Hero B"
    })

    ```

    If you send events from a live chat application, we recommend that you use
    events with the names and `properties` specified below. Sending uniform
    events that conform to the schemas defined here ensures that you can use any
    default actions that we set up for destinations that rely on Live Chat
    events—now or with destinations we add in the future.


    ## Video playback started


    When a user presses Play; after the last user action required for playback
    to begin (for example, after user login/authentication).


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_started" />


    ## Video playback paused


    When a user pauses playback.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_paused" />


    ## Video playback interrupted
      
    When a user is watching a video and playback is interrupted by an error,
    network loss, or buffering. With this event, you can send a `method` to
    indicate the reason for the interruption.


    <SchemaDefinition
    schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_interrupted" />


    ## Video playback buffer started


    Send this event when playback begins buffering content or an ad.


    <SchemaDefinition
    schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_buffer_started" />


    ## Video playback buffer completed


    Send this event when buffering finishes.


    <SchemaDefinition
    schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_buffer_completed" />


    ## Video playback seek started


    Send this event when a user begins seeking to a new position in the video.
    Use `position` to show where the user begins seeking from and
    `seek_position` to capture where the user ends.


    <SchemaDefinition
    schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_seek_started" />


    ## Video playback seek completed


    After a user manually seeks to a certain position of the content or ad in
    the playback. Pass in the position property to denote where the user desires
    to begin the playback from.


    <SchemaDefinition
    schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_seek_completed" />


    ## Video playback resumed


    Send this event when a user resumes playback after they previously paused
    playback.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_resumed" />


    ## Video playback completed


    Send this event when a user finishes a playback session.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_completed"
    />


    ## Video playback exited


    Send this event when a user navigates away from a playback/stream (scrolls
    out of view, goes to a different page, etc).


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_playback_exited" />


    ## Video content started


    Send this event when a user begins watching a video content within a
    playback session.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_content_started" />


    ## Video content playing


    Send this event as a heartbeat on a regular interval to track how far into
    the video a person is (indicated by the `position`).


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_content_playing" />


    ## Video content completed


    Send this event when a user finishes watching a video content within a
    playback session—`position` and `total_length` are equal.


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_content_completed"
    />


    ## Video ad started 


    Send this event when a user begins watching an ad within a playback session.


    ## Video ad playing


    Send this event as a heartbeat on a regular interval to track how far into
    the ad a person is (indicated by the `position`).


    <SchemaDefinition schemaRef="#/components/schemas/video_ad_playing" />


    ## Video ad completed


    Send this event when a user finishes watching an ad within a playback
    session—`position` and `total_length` are equal.

        In most cases, you'll identify people with a `userId` or an
        `anonymousId`. But when you use Customer.io as a destination, you can
        pass an empty `userId` or `anonymousId`, and identify people by their
        `email` trait.

        *You **only** need to use this method to support a few select
        destinations like Mixpanel.*


        The `alias` method reconciles identifiers in systems that don't
        automatically handle identity changes—like when a person graduates from
        an anonymous user to an identified user. 


        For example, a person typically has an `anonymousId` until you identify
        them by `userId`. Most destinations will automatically associate data
        from the anonymous ID with the new user ID when you send an `identify`
        call. But a select few destinations, like
        [Mixpanel](https://customer.io/docs/api/cdp/), won't! The `alias` call
        tells Mixpanel to represent the `anonymousId` with the new `userId`.


        If you need to use the `alias` call, you'll want to send it before you
        identify someone with a `userId`.


        If you use our web or server-side libraries, and you've already
        identified someone, we assume that this is the `userId` that you want to
        keep. Otherwise, you need to pass both the `previousId` and the
        `userId`.


        **When you use our libraries, you'll typically only provide the
        `previousId` and `userId`. The libraries fill in the rest of the payload
        automatically.**

        The batch method helps you send an array of `identify`, `group`,
        `track`, `page` and/or `screen` requests in a single call, so you don't
        have to send multiple requests. Our server-side sources use this method
        automatically to increase performance.


        Requests are limited to 500KB total per request and 32KB per call in the
        request. In a batch request, the `context` and `integrations` objects
        apply to _all calls in the request_. You can't set different context or
        integrations values for different calls in the same request.

        delete a relationship when a person is no longer on an account, leaves a
        company, or drops a class.
