            The ID for any file can be determined
            by visiting a file in the web application
            and copying the ID from the URL. For example,

            Be aware that specifying this parameter will have the

            the response unless explicitly specified, instead only
            fields for the mini representation are returned, additional
            to the fields requested.

            Additionally this field can be used to query any metadata
            applied to the file by specifying the `metadata` field as well
            as the scope and key of the template to retrieve, for example
            `?fields=metadata.enterprise_12345.contractTemplate`.

            This header can be used to access items that have not been

            explicitly shared with a user.


            Use the format `shared_link=[link]` or if a password is required
            then

            use `shared_link=[link]&shared_link_password=[password]`.


            This header can be used on the file or folder shared, as well as on

            A header required to request specific `representations`
            of a file. Use this in combination with the `fields` query
            parameter to request a specific file representation.

            The general format for these representations is
            `X-Rep-Hints: [...]` where `[...]` is one or many
            hints in the format `[fileType?query]`.

            For example, to request a `png` representation in `32x32`
            as well as `64x64` pixel dimensions provide the following
            hints.

            `x-rep-hints: [jpg?dimensions=32x32][jpg?dimensions=64x64]`

            Additionally, a `text` representation is available for all
            document file types in Box using the `[extracted_text]`
            representation.

      parameters:
        - description: >-
            The string to search for. This query is matched against item names,

            descriptions, text content of files, and various other fields of

            the different item types.


            This parameter supports a variety of operators to further refine

            the results returns.


            * `""` - by wrapping a query in double quotes only exact matches are
              returned by the API. Exact searches do not return search matches
              based on specific character sequences. Instead, they return
              matches based on phrases, that is, word sequences. For example:
              A search for `"Blue-Box"` may return search results including
              the sequence `"blue.box"`, `"Blue Box"`, and `"Blue-Box"`;
              any item containing the words `Blue` and `Box` consecutively, in
              the order specified.
            * `AND` - returns items that contain both the search terms. For
              example, a search for `marketing AND BoxWorks` returns items
              that have both `marketing` and `BoxWorks` within its text in any order.
              It does not return a result that only has `BoxWorks` in its text.
            * `OR` - returns items that contain either of the search terms. For
              example, a search for `marketing OR BoxWorks` returns a result that
              has either `marketing` or `BoxWorks` within its text. Using this
              operator is not necessary as we implicitly interpret multi-word
              queries as `OR` unless another supported boolean term is used.
            * `NOT` - returns items that do not contain the search term
            provided.
              For example, a search for `marketing AND NOT BoxWorks` returns a result
              that has only `marketing` within its text. Results containing
              `BoxWorks` are omitted.

            We do not support lower case (that is,

            `and`, `or`, and `not`) or mixed case (that is, `And`, `Or`, and
            `Not`)

            operators.

            results to content that is available to the currently authenticated

            Defines the order in which search results are returned. This API

            defaults to returning items by relevance unless this parameter is

            explicitly specified.


            * `relevance` (default) returns the results sorted by relevance to
            the

            query search term. The relevance is based on the occurrence of the
            search

            term in the items name, description, content, and additional
            properties.

            * `modified_at` returns the results ordered in descending order by
            date

            at which the item was last modified.

            defaults to returning items in descending (`DESC`) order unless this

            parameter is explicitly specified.


            When results are sorted by `relevance` the ordering is locked to
            returning

            items in descending order of relevance, and this parameter is

            If searching in trash is not performed, an empty result set

      description: >-
        Move all of the items (files, folders and workflows) owned by a user
        into

        another user's account


        Only the root folder (`0`) can be transferred.


        Folders can only be moved across users by users with administrative

        permissions.


        All existing shared links and folder-level collaborations are
        transferred

        during the operation. Please note that while collaborations at the
        individual

        file-level are transferred during the operation, the collaborations are

        deleted when the original user is deleted.


        This call will be performed synchronously which might lead to a slow
        response

        when the source user has a large number of items in all of its folders.


        If the destination path has a metadata cascade policy attached to any of

        the parent folders, a metadata cascade operation will be kicked off

        asynchronously.


        There is currently no way to check for when this operation is finished.


        The destination folder's name will be in the format `{User}'s Files and

        Folders`, where `{User}` is the display name of the user.


        To make this API call your application will need to have the "Read and
        write

        all files and folders stored in Box" scope enabled.


        Please make sure the destination user has access to `Relay` or `Relay
        Lite`,

        and has access to the files and folders involved in the workflows being

        transferred.


        Admins will receive an email when the operation is completed.

      summary: Get events long poll endpoint
      operationId: options_events
      description: >-
        Returns a list of real-time servers that can be used for long-polling
        updates

        to the [event stream](https://raw.githubusercontent.com).


        Long polling is the concept where a HTTP request is kept open until the

        server sends a response, then repeating the process over and over to
        receive

        updated responses.


        Long polling the event stream can only be used for user events, not for

        enterprise events.


        To use long polling, first use this endpoint to retrieve a list of long
        poll

        URLs. Next, make a long poll request to any of the provided URLs.


        When an event occurs in monitored account a response with the value

        `new_change` will be sent. The response contains no other details as

        it only serves as a prompt to take further action such as sending a

        request to the [events endpoint](https://raw.githubusercontent.com) with
        the last known

        `stream_position`.


        After the server sends this response it closes the connection. You must
        now

        repeat the long poll process to begin listening for events again.


        If no events occur for a while and the connection times out you will

        receive a response with the value `reconnect`. When you receive this
        response

        you’ll make another call to this endpoint to restart the process.


        If you receive no events in `retry_timeout` seconds then you will need
        to

        make another request to the real-time server (one of the URLs in the
        response

        for this endpoint). This might be necessary due to network errors.


        Finally, if you receive a `max_retries` error when making a request to
        the

        real-time server, you should start over by making a call to this
        endpoint

        first.

              time, but latency will be much higher than `admin_logs_streaming`.

        returns a `download_url` and a `status_url` that can be used to download

        The limit for an archive is either the Account's upload limit or

        10,000 files, whichever is met first.


        **Note**: Downloading a large file can be

        affected by various

        factors such as distance, network latency,

        bandwidth, and congestion, as well as packet loss

        ratio and current server load.

        For these reasons we recommend that a maximum ZIP archive

        total size does not exceed 25GB.

            Returns an error if some of the parameters are missing or

            In most cases, this error might happen because the JSON request body
            is

            not valid JSON, any of the items has an incorrect or missing ID, any
            of

            has been

            added to the list of folders to add to the archive.


            The following is a list of common error codes for this response.


            * `bad_request` - the request body is missing, invalid, or both the
            list

            of files and folders are empty. Additionally, it this error might be

            returned when attempting to add the root folder with ID `0` to an
            archive.

            * `zip_download_file_count_exceeded_limit` - the requested files and

            folders would result in an archive with more than 10,000 files. The

            request will have to be split into multiple requests to reduce the
            number

            of files per archive.

            * `zip_download_pre_compressed_bytes_exceeded_limit` - the requested
            files

            and folders would result in an archive with more than the allowed
            download

            limit. The request will have to be split into multiple requests to
            reduce

            the size of the archive.

                    To access the metadata for a file or folder, first use the

                    available to your

                    enterprise.


                    Then use the `GET /files/:id` or `GET /folder/:id`

                    endpoint with the `fields` query parameter to get

                    the metadata by ID.


                    To request a metadata instance for a particular `scope` and
                    `templateKey`

                    use the following format for the `fields` parameter:

                    `metadata.<scope>.<templateKey>`

        A retention policy blocks permanent deletion of content
        for a specified amount of time. Admins can apply policies to
        specified folders, or an entire enterprise. A file version retention
        is a  record for a retained file version. To use this feature,
        you must  have the manage retention policies scope enabled for your
        API key via  your application management console. For more information
        about retention policies, please visit our help documentation

                    use the following format for the `fields` parameter:

                user events for changes to the item. The application would
                ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
                is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
                fetched resource.

                to filter out user events that would have occurred before this
                identifier was read.

                An example would be where a Box Drive-like application
                would fetch an item via the API, and then listen to incoming
                user events for changes to the item. The application would
                ignore any user events where the `sequence_id` in the event
                is smaller than or equal to the `sequence_id` in the originally
                fetched resource.
