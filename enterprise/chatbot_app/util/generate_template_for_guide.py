## Introduction
Briefly introduce the purpose of the guide.
Mention the specific customer configuration and its relevance to the guide.
Outline the main objective: to assist in creating a journey application in Python using the provided API and customer-specific configuration.
## Prerequisites
List the prerequisites including Python version, any libraries or frameworks needed (e.g., requests for HTTP requests).
Instructions on setting up the development environment.
Authentication requirements, mentioning both Basic and OAuth2 options as per the OpenAPI spec.
## Authentication Setup
Explain both authentication methods (Basic and OAuth2) and when to use each.
Code Snippet: Provide Python code for setting up OAuth2 authentication, including obtaining a bearer token using the client credentials flow.
Code Snippet: Provide Python code for setting up Basic authentication using the provided workflow token and secret.
## Understanding the Journey Application
Describe what a journey application is based on the OpenAPI documentation.
Explain the role of journey_token and how it is used in the API.
Mention the use of headers like alloy-journey-override-sync and their effects on synchronous vs. asynchronous responses.
## Configuration Specifics for the Customer
Detail the customer-specific configuration including journey_token, journey_version, and the specific branch and workflow setup.
Explain the importance of including required parameters (gender and addresses.state) in the journey application as per the customer's journey configuration.
## Creating a Journey Application
Step-by-step instructions on using the Create Journey Application endpoint.
Code Snippet: Python code to construct the request body with all required fields, including handling of multiple entities and branches.
Code Snippet: Python code to make the POST request to create the journey application, handling potential responses.
Discuss the implications of setting headers like alloy-sandbox and alloy-multi-environment-config-token.
## Handling Responses
Explain how to interpret the JSON responses from the API.
Discuss different scenarios based on the alloy-journey-override-sync header's value.
Code Snippet: Python code to parse and display the response data.
## Error Handling
Provide guidance on common API errors and how to handle them in Python.
Code Snippet: Python code for basic error handling during API requests.
## Testing and Validation
Instructions on how to test the journey application creation.
Tips on validating the data against the customer's specific requirements and configurations.
## Conclusion
Summarize the guide's content.
Encourage testing and iteration based on the specific needs and feedback.
## Appendix
Include any additional resources, links to API documentation, or further reading.
