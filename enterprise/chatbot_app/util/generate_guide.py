## Introduction
This guide is designed to assist you in creating a journey application using the Alloy API, tailored specifically to your configuration. Your journey application uses a specific `journey_token` and is configured to include specific parameters that are crucial for your workflow.

## Authentication and Authorization
Alloy API supports two types of security schemes: HTTP Basic Authentication and OAuth2.

### HTTP Basic Authentication
To authenticate using HTTP Basic Authentication, use the following Python code snippet:

```python
import requests
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth

url = "https://demo-qasandbox.alloy.co/v1/your_endpoint"
response = requests.get(url, auth=HTTPBasicAuth(\'your_username\', \'your_password\'))
```

### OAuth2 Client Credentials Flow
To obtain a bearer token using OAuth2 client credentials flow, use this Python code:

```python
import requests

url = "https://demo-qasandbox.alloy.co/v1/oauth/bearer"
client_id = "your_client_id"
client_secret = "your_client_secret"

response = requests.post(url, auth=(client_id, client_secret))
bearer_token = response.json().get(\'access_token\')
```

Use the obtained tokens in subsequent API requests by including them in the Authorization header:

```python
headers = {
    \'Authorization\': f\'Bearer {bearer_token}\'
}
response = requests.get("https://demo-qasandbox.alloy.co/v1/your_endpoint", headers=headers)
```

## Server Information
The base URL for API requests is `https://demo-qasandbox.alloy.co/v1`.

## Creating a Journey Application
Creating a journey application involves sending a POST request to the `/journeys/{journey_token}/applications` endpoint. This process registers one or more entities for a specific journey defined by your configuration.

### Endpoint
`POST /journeys/J-VCQoADBJxeHtmdAvFqoS/applications`

### Python Code Snippet
Here\'s how to construct the HTTP POST request:

```python
import requests

url = "https://demo-qasandbox.alloy.co/v1/journeys/J-VCQoADBJxeHtmdAvFqoS/applications"
headers = {
    \'Authorization\': \'Bearer your_access_token\',
    \'alloy-journey-override-sync\': \'false\',
    \'alloy-sandbox\': \'true\',
    \'alloy-sandbox-services\': \'Socure3,EnhancedPersonSearch\',
    \'alloy-refresh-cache\': \'true\',
    \'alloy-multi-environment-config-token\': \'MEC-1t94UrgAwOGmaVUy94rK\'
}
data = {
    # Include JSON body from the next section
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=data)
```

### Important Headers
- `alloy-journey-override-sync`: Set to `true` for asynchronous responses.
- `alloy-sandbox`: Use `true` to run in the sandbox environment.
- `alloy-sandbox-services`: Specify services to run in sandbox.
- `alloy-refresh-cache`: Set to `true` to refresh cached responses.
- `alloy-multi-environment-config-token`: Use to specify the configuration token.

### `fullData` Query Parameter
Include `fullData=true` in the query to receive full evaluation responses in the API response.

## Request Body Structure
The request body should include an `entities` array with details about each entity involved in the journey application.

### Example JSON Body
```json
{
    "entities": [
        {
            "entity_type": "person",
            "branch_name": "branch1",
            "data": {
                "gender": "male",
                "addresses": [
                    {
                        "state": "NY"
                    }
                ],
                "document_license": "optional_value"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

## Handling Responses
Handle synchronous and asynchronous responses by checking the HTTP status code. A `201 Created` status indicates success.

### Python Code to Parse JSON Response
```python
if response.status_code == 201:
    data = response.json()
    print("Application created successfully:", data)
else:
    print("Failed to create application:", response.status_code)
```

## Error Handling
Common API errors include `400 Bad Request` and `401 Unauthorized`. Handle these gracefully:

```python
if response.status_code != 201:
    print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
```

## Testing and Validation
Test the journey application creation by sending requests with both required and optional parameters. Validate the responses to ensure they meet the configured requirements.
