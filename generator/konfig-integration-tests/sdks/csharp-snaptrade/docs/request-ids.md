# Request IDs

Each SnapTrade API request has an associated request identifier.

You can find this value in the response headers, under `X-Request-ID`. For example, running a simple `curl` request and glancing at the headers for the response will give something like this:

```
curl -v https://api.snaptrade.com/api/v1
