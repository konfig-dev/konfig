## How to hide operations

To hide operations you can use `hideOperations` property in `portal` section of
`konfig.yaml` file. The property is a map where keys are paths to operations and
values are maps with HTTP methods as keys and boolean values. If the value is
`true` then the operation will be hidden in the `API Reference` page.

```yaml konfig.yaml focus=8:10
portal:
  title: Acme
  primaryColor: '#9fc1be'
  favicon: favicon.png
  logo: portal-logo.png
  socials:
    website: https://acme.com
  hideOperations:
    /holdings:
      get: true
  hideSecurity:
    - name: PartnerSignature
    - name: PartnerTimestamp
```

## How to hide security requirements

To hide security requirements you can use `hideSecurity` property in `portal`.
The property is a list of security requirements names that should be hidden in
the `API Reference` page.

```yaml konfig.yaml focus=11:13
portal:
  title: Acme
  primaryColor: '#9fc1be'
  favicon: favicon.png
  logo: portal-logo.png
  socials:
    website: https://acme.com
  hideOperations:
    /holdings:
      get: true
  hideSecurity:
    - name: PartnerSignature
    - name: PartnerTimestamp
```

## How to order operations in API Reference

<CH.Section>

To order the list of operations in your API Reference page, you can configure
the [`order`](focus://1) property in your `konfig.yaml` file. Here are the
important things to know about the `order` property:

- The `order` property is a [list of objects with a "tag" property and an
"operations" property](focus://2:12).
- The ["tag" property is a string that refers to a tag in
your OpenAPI specification](focus://2).
- The ["operations" property is the order of operations
that you want to appear under that tag](focus://3:5).
- An operation can be specified by its
["operationId"](focus://8) or by its ["path" and "method"](focus://11:12).

<Admonition title="Unspecified Operations" type="info">
Operations and tags that are not specified in the `order` property will appear
at the end of the list in the order that they appear in your OpenAPI specification.

```yaml konfig.yaml
order:
  - tag: user
    operations:
      - user_create
      - user_login
  - tag: store
    operations:
      - store_placeOrder
  - tag: pet
    operations:
      - path: /pet
        method: post
portal:
  title: Acme
  primaryColor: "#1f334e"
