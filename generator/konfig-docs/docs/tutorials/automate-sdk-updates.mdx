# Automate SDK Updates

## Required Setup

Install [Konfig's GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/konfig-bot) to your SDK
repository. This allows Konfig to automatically create PRs and inspect your
`konfig.yaml` file.

## Push and Poll

Today there are two ways of automating SDK updates with Konfig:

- [GitHub Action](automate-sdk-updates#github-action)

  - Use GitHub Action if you version control your OAS and would like
    to keep the single source of truth in an existing repo. This is often the case
    if you also integrate with other documentation platforms or already have a
    git-based workflow for updating your OAS.

- [Polling](automate-sdk-updates#polling)
  - Use Polling when you do not version control your OAS and instead serve your OAS as a public endpoint

### GitHub Action

Add the following GitHub Action under `.github/workflows/konfig-push.yaml` to
the repository that hosts your OAS. Replace the following values with your own:

<CH.Section>

1. [Production Branch](focus://5)
2. [Path to OpenAPI Specification](focus://22[29:37])
3. [Owner of SDK repository](focus://22[41:50])
4. [Name of SDK repository](focus://22[55:64])

```yaml .github/workflows/konfig-push.yaml
# from ./assets/konfig-push.yaml
```

</CH.Section>

### Polling

To setup polling please [setup a time](/schedule-demo) to talk and we will get you setup.

## Versioning and Publishing

Konfig offers reusable workflows, published in the `konfig-dev/automation` repository, that make it easy to automate
the entire process from start to finish: simply make a change to your OpenAPI spec and new versions of your SDKs will
be published within minutes. Currently, only python and typescript SDKs are supported.

### How It Works

The first step in the automation process is to make a pull request against your SDK repository with OpenAPI spec
changes. This can be done manually, or through the automated [push/poll](#push-and-poll) processes described above.

This triggers the first automation stage, where the new spec is fixed and linted. If Konfig's linter reports any errors
with the new spec, the automation process stops and the issues are reported. Pushing fixes to the PR automatically
retriggers the process.

If the changes to the spec pass our linter, your SDKs will be regenerated and tested. Once again, any test failures
will stop the process; pushing fixes retriggers the process, as before. On successful testing of your new SDKs,
the pull request is automatically merged.

This sets off the second automation stage, which shortly thereafter creates a version bump pull request in your SDK
repository. When you are ready to release the new version of your SDKs, simply merge the PR, and your SDKs are
published to their respective package managers! ðŸŽ‰

If you wish to accumulate additional changes before publishing, hold off on merging the PR and make additional
OpenAPI spec changes (described above) or other custom changes (described below); the version bump PR is automatically
updated to include these changes.

To publish custom changes to an SDK, such as adding a custom wrapper method over a generated SDK method, run
`konfig changeset` after making the changes. Push your changes along with the resulting `changeset` file, and a
version bump pull request will be created/updated with your changes. From there, the process is the same as above.

Konfig's automation seemlessly supports SDKs which live in their own git submodules. Having one or more
SDKs in their own submodule repositories changes nothing about the process described above. In addition, having multiple
SDK environments in the same repository is likewise supported seemlessly; for example, you can have two `konfig.yaml`
files in the same repository, at `./staging/konfig.yaml` and `./prod/konfig.yaml` with no extra steps to the setup and
no differences in your process.

### Setting Up Automation for your SDKs

To set up this automation pipeline for your SDKs, you will first need to add the following two github workflow files
to your top-level SDK repository in `./.github/workflows`. These workflows call Konfig's reusable workflows in
`konfig-dev/automation`. If different, replace `main` with the name of your production branch.

```yaml .github/workflows/regenerate-sdks-on-oas-change.yaml
# from ./assets/regenerate-sdks-on-oas-change.yaml
```

```yaml .github/workflows/release.yaml
# from ./assets/release.yaml
```

Next, you will need to set some GitHub repository secrets to provide environment variables used during the testing
and publishing process. To add a new repository secret, navigate to your GitHub SDK repository, then go to
`Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` > `New Repository Secret`. Add the following secrets:
1. **KONFIG_API_KEY**
    - Received from Konfig.
    - Used to authenticate your identity in Konfig's backend.
2. **TEST_ENV**
    - Constructed from *all* of your environment variables used in testing your SDKs. Omit if no environment variables
    are required for testing.
    - Format in key=value pairs (no spaces) separated by newlines.
    - Rest assured that our automation pipeline takes the necessary steps to ensure that no individual secret values are
    leaked despite having multiple sensitive values in one repository secret.
3. **NPM_TOKEN**
    - Received from Konfig.
    - Scoped token for publishing typescript SDKs to `npm`. Omit if you do not have a typescript SDK.
4. **PYPI_TOKEN_1**
    - Received from Konfig.
    - Scoped token for publishing python SDKs to `PyPi`. Omit if you do not have a python SDK.
    - `PyPi` only allows scoped tokens for a single package. In the case where you have multiple `konfig.yaml` files in
    your SDK repository specifying different `PyPi` packages, you will need a token per package. Set any additional
    tokens as repository secrets named PYPI_TOKEN_2, etc.

Finally, if you have a python SDK, you will need to modify your `konfig.yaml` file like so: Set
`generators.python.pypiApiTokenEnvironmentVariable` to the name of the token used to publish to `PyPi` for that
package. This tells Konfig's publishing script to publish to `PyPi` using that token instead of a username/password.

```yaml konfig.yaml
# from ./assets/konfig.yaml

### Additional Setup For Submodules

If one or more of your SDKs live in a git submodule, then you must set up a `Deploy Key` for each submodule repository
to allow the workflow running in your top-level SDK repository to read and write from the submodule repositories.
Perform the following steps for each submodule.

1. Run `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "git@github.com:owner/repo.git"` on your machine to generate a public and private
key pair.
    - Make sure to replace `owner` and `repo` with the org and repo name of your **sumbodule** repository.
    - Make sure that you do **not** set a passcode on the key.
2. Add the **public** key to your **submodule** repository as a `Deploy Key`
    - From your submodule repository, go to `Settings` > `Deploy Keys` > `Add Deploy Key`.
    - The title of the key does not matter (e.g. "Konfig Automation Deploy Key").
    - You **must** check the "Allow write access" box.
3. Add the **private** key to your **top-level** SDK repository as a repository secret.
    - From your top-level repository, go to `Settings` > `Secrets and variables` > `Actions` > `New Repository Secret`
    - Call the secret `SUBMODULE_DEPLOY_KEY_<LANGUAGE>` (e.g. `SUBMODULE_DEPLOY_KEY_TYPESCRIPT`)
