## duplicate-sdk-method-name

Severity: Warning

#### Example

```
Duplicate case-insensitive SDK method name "find" detected. Please rename one of the operations.
```

#### Explanation

SDK methods are generated from operation names. If two operations have the same
name then the SDK method names will conflict. This is a warning because it is
possible that the operations are the same and the developer should
consider renaming the operation to be more descriptive.

For example, if you have two operations with the same name "find" then the SDK
method names will conflict. You should consider renaming one of the operations
to be more descriptive such as "findOne" and "findMultiple".

```yaml
paths:
  /pets:
    get:
      operationId: Pet_find
      summary: "Finds all pets"
      responses:
        200:
          description: OK
          schema:
            type: array
            items:
              $ref: "#/definitions/Pet"
  /pets/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: Pet_find
      summary: "Finds one pet by id"
      responses:
        200:
          description: OK
          schema:
            $ref: "#/definitions/Pet"
```

## invalid-required-property-syntax

Severity: Warning

#### Example

```
Detected more than 3 words in required property item: "id firstName lastName email". This possibly due to invalid YAML list syntax.
```

#### Explanation

If you accidentally forget to include "-" characters at the beginning of each
line in YAML, you will instead produce a single string with spaces. This is most
likely not intended and will cause unexpected output in the generated SDKs.

##### Incorrect

```yaml
required:
  - id
    firstName
    lastName
    email
```

#### Correct

```yaml
required:
  - id
  - firstName
  - lastName
  - email
```

---

## invalid-server-urls-oas3

Severity: Error

#### Example

```
"http://{{baseurl}}" is not a valid URL
```

#### Explanation

Server URLs are hard-coded and used in the generated SDKs so they must be valid
URLs. So your server URLs must match the following regex.

```
/https?:\/\/(www\.)?[-a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{1,256}\.[a-zA-Z0-9()]{1,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9()@:%_\+.~#?&//=]*)/
```

---

## missing-date-format

Severity: Warning

#### Example

```
Schema type of "string" has no format "date" but has example "2022-04-12"
```

#### Explanation

If your example contains an example that could be formatted as `date` (As
defined by full-date - [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339))

Primitive data types and their formats are mentioned in the OpenAPI
Specification here: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#data-types.

---

## missing-date-time-format

Severity: Warning

#### Example

```
Schema type of "string" has no format "date-time" but has example "2022-04-12T12:00:00+00:00"
```

#### Explanation

If your example contains an example that could be formatted as `date-time` (As
defined by date-time - [RFC3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339)).

Primitive data types and their formats are mentioned in the OpenAPI
Specification here: https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3#data-types.

---

## no-parameter-named-requestbody

Severity: Error

#### Example

```
Parameter's are not allowed to have a name that can be camelcased to "requestBody" as it is a reserved keyword for Konfig's TypeScript SDK
```

#### Explanation

Parameters named `requestBody` will cause a compilation error in Konfig's TypeScript SDK as its a reserved keyword for providing arguments to SDK methods.

---

## boolean-query-parameter

Severity: Information

#### Example

```
There is no standard method of serializing boolean values in query parameters according to RFC 6570 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6570)
```

#### Explanation

Boolean query parameters are OK to use but do note that there is no standard for
serializing boolean values in query parameters. Konfig defaults to lowercase
"true" and "false" string values but this might not necessarily be compatible
with your server implementation.

---

## disallowed-header-names-request

Severity: Error

#### Example

```
Konfig's Python SDK does not allow 'Accept', 'Content-Type', or 'Authorization' to be specified as a header in the request
```

#### Explanation

See [disallowed-header-names-response](#disallowed-header-names-response)

---

## disallowed-header-names-response

Severity: Error

#### Example

```
Konfig's Python SDK does not allow 'Accept', 'Content-Type', or 'Authorization' to be specified as a header in the response
```

#### Explanation

The disallowed headers should be implicit as part of the operation's media
object and security requirements. Today we throw an error at runtime if we
detect disallowed headers in our Python SDK.

---

## empty-property-name

Severity: Error

#### Example

```
Empty property names cause generated SDKs to fail
```

#### Explanation

Empty property names on object type schemas breaks Konfig's generated SDKs. Example:

```yaml
type: object
properties:
  "": # problematic empty property name
    type: string
```

---

## duplicate-tag-names

Severitiy: Warning

#### Example

```
Duplicate case-insensitive tag name "pet"
```

#### Explanation

There is no functional difference between two tags which are case-insensitive
equal as they will be converted to each language's idiomatic naming convention.
Its just that duplicate names is simply confusing.

---

## missing-2xx-response

Severity: Warning

#### Example

```
Specify a "default" or "2xx" range HTTP Status Code response
```

#### Explanation

Generated SDK methods will specify a return type either in documentation or
through types if a "default" or "2xx" range response is described in an
operation. Returning results from an API call can be helpful for debugging or
logging results.

---

## object-with-no-properties

Severity: Hint

#### Example

```
Schema type of "object" has no properties
```

#### Explanation

Describing the properties of an "object" type schema helps generate typed
classes in SDKs. Typed classes allow for better in-line documentation and
serialization/deserialization. We suggest that you describe the properties of
the "object" type schema by filling out the "properties" field.

Note that in some cases you intentionally want a free-form object type. In that
case, you can ignore this rule by adding the following field to your top-level
info object in your OAS.

```json openapi.json focus=6:8
{
  "info": {
    "title": "My API",
    "description": "My awesome API",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "x-konfig-ignore": {
      "object-with-no-properties": true
    }
  }
}
```

---

## structured-request-body

#### Example

```
Detected JSON example '{"hello":"world"}'. Request body schemas should be structured to generate helpful method parameters and classes.
```

#### Explanation

Generate SDKs by providing schemas instead of raw string types (i.e. "string"
type with serialized JSON). In other words, your example should be expressed as
structured data instead of a raw string.

---

## duplicate-schema-name-oas2

#### Example

```
Duplicate case-insensitive schema name "User"
```

#### Explanation

See [duplicate-schema-name-oas3](#duplicate-schema-name-oas3)

---

## duplicate-schema-name-oas3

#### Example

```
Duplicate case-insensitive schema name "User"
```

#### Explanation

Our generator will coerce names to conform to idiomatic naming conventions such
as PascalCase for Java (e.g. "user" -> "User" or "User" -> "user"). This means
that case insensitive equal schema names will conflict thus causing errors
in the generated output. Prefer naming things with unique case insensitive
names.

---

## adv-security-schemes-defined

#### Example

```
This API definition does not have any security scheme defined.
```

#### Explanation

Defining security schemes is important to auto-generate configurations state in SDKs.

---

## multiple-tags

#### Example

```
Having more than 1 tag can be confusing as generated SDKs will only show up under one tag.
```

#### Explanation

Tags are used to logically namespace SDK methods into separate classes. If you
have more than 1 tag for an operation then it will show up under two namespaces.
Furthermore, some languages like TypeScript won't even allow you to export two
methods of the same name from the top-level `index.ts` file so it won't even
compile.

---

## operationId-pattern

#### Example

```
Does not match regex: "/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+_(?![0-9]+$)[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/g". Prefix operation IDs with "Tag_" (https://konfigthis.com/docs/tutorials/naming-operation-ids)
```

#### Explanation

See [how to name your operation IDs](tutorials/naming-operation-ids)

---

## tag-naming-convention

#### Example

```
Detected use of ">" character. This could be because you are exporting from Postman. Folders in Postman are bad for namespace structuring in SDKs. Always prefer a flat namespacing structure for discoverability and succinct code.
```

#### Explanation

There could be multiple possible issues:

- `konfig p2o` uses the ">" character to denote folder structure in Tags. You should prefer flat naming structure for better quality SDKs. Use [konfig fix](docs/tutorials/fix-openapi-spec) to do this.
- "default" is the tag generated for `konfig p2o` if requests are not structured into folders in Postman. We should rename this to something more meaningful such as entites like "Pet" or concepts like "Authorization"

---

## components-schemas-defined-oas2

#### Example

```
APIs should define schemas for developer friendly SDK generation.
```

#### Explanation

See [components-schemas-defined-oas3](#explanation-components-schemas-defined-oas3)

---

## components-schemas-defined-oas3

#### Example

```
APIs should define schemas for developer friendly SDK generation.
```

#### Explanation (components-schemas-defined-oas3)

Defining schemas is important for generating native classes in SDKs for strongly
typed request and response bodies. It also makes it easy to document schemas
in-line so developers can move faster in their IDE.

---

## use-security-instead

#### Example

```
Use security requirement "clientId" instead of parameter with name "client_id"
```

#### Explanation

A warning is thrown if a parameter describes the same parameter inferred by a
security scheme declared in the global OAS. You should always prefer using
security requirement instead. Security requirements can be configured once in
the SDK and be automatically provided for any operations that need require the
security scheme. Think of security as "state" for the SDK instances.

Example suggested change:

```diff
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Example API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  "/":
    get:
-     parameters:
-       - name: client_id
-         in: query
+     security:
+       clientId: []
      responses: {}
components:
  securitySchemes:
    clientId:
      name: client_id
      type: apiKey
      in: query
```

---

## redundant-security-and-parameter

#### Example

```
Detected security requirement and parameter with the same name "Authorization" paths./api/pet.create
```

#### Explanation

If a security requirement describe conflicting parameters then undesirable code
will be generated for SDKs. For example providing a parameter with the
"Authorization" header and also adding an API key security requirement which
also uses the "Authorization" header will throw this warning. Note that global
**and** local security requirements are also considered.

---

## list-usage-of-security

#### Example

```
Potential misuse of the security field. Only use list when you have multiple security strategies. (i.e. list vs map is significant https://swagger.io/docs/specification/authentication/)
```

#### Explanation

Expressing security requirements as a list implies that there are different strategies for authentication. Often this is not the case so a warning is thrown to ensure your API security requirements are being properly expressed.

---

## empty-response-body-schema

#### Example

```
Provide a response body schema to provide helpful information regarding the operation.
```

#### Explanation

Describe schemas to generate native classes in SDKs for response of operations.

<Admonition type="note">
  Response body can be empty if you export from Postman Collections without
  [saving example
  responses](docs/tutorials/postman-to-openapi#1-save-example-responses-in-postman).
  Otherwise use [konfig fix](docs/tutorials/fix-openapi-spec) to easily populate
  with examples and generate the schema field.
</Admonition>

---

## empty-request-body-content

#### Example

```
Empty request body content is not allowed for SDK generation
```

#### Explanation

Request body with no media type is unsupported.

---

## components-schemas-defined-oas3

#### Example

```
APIs should define schemas for developer friendly SDK generation.
```

#### Explanation

In OAS 3.x, use the [schemas field](https://swagger.io/specification/#components-object) to define a map of
[schema objects](https://swagger.io/specification/#schema-object). This is important to generate native classes in generated SDKs.

---

## operation-operationId

#### Example

```
Assign Operation#operationId to create better SDK method names.
```

#### Explanation

Konfig uses an [Operation Object's](https://swagger.io/specification/#operation-object) `operationId`
field to assign names to generated methods of SDKs. If no `operationId` is
assigned then SDK method names are generated from the HTTP method and path. For
developer-friendly SDKs it is important that you provide friendly method names
that are easy to discover and succint.

---

## potential-incorrect-type

#### Example

```
Could be integer type based on example. Ensure your types are correct.
```

#### Explanation

Every data type describe in your OAS must be correct to generate working SDKs. To ensure correctness,
Konfig's linter will check to see if examples could represent other data types.
In the following example the string `"3291231"` could represent an `integer`
type so a warning is thrown.

```yaml
components:
  schemas:
    User:
    type: object
    properties:
      id:
        type: string
        example: "3291231"
```

To ignore the error add the `x-konfig-ignore` to the top-level `info` object:

```yaml
info:
  title: Example API
  version: 1.0.0
  x-konfig-ignore:
    potential-incorrect-type: true
```
