Ahrefs [saving millions by not even using a cloud

serverless has recently been under a lot of scrutiny.

But still, everyone and their pet goldfish is making a serverless runtime (see

and literally hundreds more). Is it all hype? Is there real 100% objective merit? Where
does serverless shine? Where do the trade-offs make sense?

To understand how developers are receiving serverless, let's look at what
developers have to say on Reddit, Twitter, Hacker News, and YouTube. To do this
I parsed 1,000s of discussions and synthesized my findings in this article,
striving to present only thought-provoking perspectives.

Next, I transcribed these discussions onto a whiteboard, organizing them into
"Pro Serverless," "Anti Serverless," or "Neutral" categories, and then
clustering them into distinct perspectives. Each section in this post showcases
a perspective while referencing pertinent discussions. To conclude, I highlight
a thought-provoking blog post from Amazon that serve as informative case studies
in this ongoing debate.

design of Amazon's system when using serverless technology. There was no inherent problem with the serverless service itself.
