### About SnapTrade

[SnapTrade](https://snaptrade.com/) is a Canadian fintech company founded in 2017 with the goal of
offering a superior API to fintechs that are connecting to retail brokerage and
cryptocurrency exchange accounts. SnapTrade provides fintechs a better user
experience in their apps through speed of access to investment data, reliable
connections, real-time and unified investing data, and broad broker coverage.

### The Problem

[SnapTrade's API](https://docs.snaptrade.com/) is purpose-built and as a result, it was more complex to
implement for  customers that had inexperienced developers or were using an
outsourced dev shop to do the integration. To onboard some of their early
customers, SnapTrade had to manually show and tell each customer how to
implement the feature their customer wanted (i.e. how to use SnapTrade to
process a stock trade) and how to write the code to correctly authenticate and
call the API. This took months of effort. Furthermore, if the customer was using
a programming language SnapTrade was unfamiliar with, it was very difficult for
SnapTrade to support that customer during onboarding. This resulted in lost
sales as customers dropped out of the funnel and higher costs as SnapTrade was
burning engineering hours onboarding customers.

### The Solution

SnapTrade turned to Konfig's SDKs to solve these challenges. Konfig
auto-generates and distributes SDKs in 6 languages that SnapTrade's customers
import into their IDE, which helps guide them through integrating with
SnapTrade's API. Best of all, by using Konfig's end-to-end automated process, no
work is required on SnapTrade's part - every time SnapTrade updates their
OpenAPI spec as part of their normal workflow, Konfig is notified and generates,
tests, and publishes a new set of SDKs for their customers to use.

> "Before [Konfig], we always had to have back and forth with signature and
> timestamp handling in order to onboard properly. Now, this is all handled in the
> SDK's so all we have to do is have an introductory call to explain how the api
> works then get them a set of keys!"

### Results and Benefits

By using Konfig's SDK generation tool, SnapTrade can offer a fast and seamless
onboarding experience for customers onto their API, no matter what language they
are using. In turn, customers were able to more quickly see the value of
SnapTrade's API and become delighted customers using SnapTrade in production.
The SDKs also provided value to SnapTrade by more effectively marketing the
quality and usability of the product to developers, becoming a key sales tool
for winning more deals.

  <Stats.Stat label="Average savings of developer time onboarding new customers" number="2 Months"/>
  <Stats.Stat label="More customers over 7 months" number="55%"/>
  <Stats.Stat label="Increase in potential customers evaluating the product" number="100%"/>
  <Stats.Stat label="More languages supported by SDKs" number="3x"/>
</Stats.Wrapper>

#### Other benefits of using Konfig to generate their SDKs include

- Quicker time to market. If SnapTrade wanted to build out and maintain these
SDKs themselves it would have taken them hundreds or thousands of engineering
hours.
- Hands on support to get high-quality SDKs. Beyond technical speed, Konfig
prioritizes the client experience at all times. Konfig linted and fixed errors
in SnapTrade's OpenAPI spec and modified templates so SnapTrade was able to
generate the exact SDKs that they wanted.
- No maintenance cost. Konfig integrates with SnapTrade's CD pipeline so SDKs
are always up-to-date with API changes and any bugs or feature requests are
handled by Konfig.

> "A lot of the SDK's are in languages that our team has less experience with.
> In order to write these by hand we would have to learn the language syntax and
> spend hours compiling, debugging and reworking code. Konfig makes this process
> so much easier and faster."

### Conclusion

Today, over 50% of SnapTrade's customers use Konfig's SDKs to interact with
their API. SnapTrade encourages all new customers to trial and onboard on to
their API using our SDKs.

> "Over 50% of our active customers are using SDK's. We are always encouraging the
> other half to try the SDK's, and  as important, recommending ways for the half
> that are using them  to use the SDK's more effectively. When we provide keys to
> prospective customers, we also let them know about the Online SDK to test out
> functionality."
