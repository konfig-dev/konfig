Last week we merged our plugin into [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) ([Pull
Request](https://github.com/backstage/backstage/pull/19261)) to generate SDKs
for internal services. For those that love to follow and discuss technology, we
also published a [blog post](/blog/graphql-vs-rest) where Dylan reviewed 1,000s
of GraphQL vs. REST perspectives. We also made a lot of improvements to our
Python, TypeScript, and PHP SDK generators.

### Backstage Plugin

SDKs help onboard external developers but we know that the same problem exists
inside organizations when integrating APIs from different teams owning different
services. [Backstage](https://backstage.io/) is a developer portal for
centralizing your infrastructure and enabling product teams to quickly ship
high-quality code. So we created a Backstage plugin to auto-generate SDKs for
internal API services. If you are interested in generating SDKs for your
internal APIs [please reach out to us and we would love to
talk](https://calendly.com/dylan-konfig/meet). Check out our official plugin
[here](https://github.com/konfig-dev/backstage-plugin-konfig/tree/main/plugins/backstage-plugin-konfig)!

### Blog Post: I Reviewed 1,000s of GraphQL vs. REST Perspectives

Ask any developer: do you prefer GraphQL or REST? This often leads to
opinionated conversations, sometimes even devolving into vulgar opinions rather
than objective facts. To delve into the GraphQL vs. REST debate, I scoured
platforms where developers frequently discuss such matters: YouTube, Reddit,
Twitter, and Hacker News. I parsed 1,000s of discussions and synthesized my
findings in this blog post, striving to present only thought-provoking
perspectives. Read more [here](/blog/graphql-vs-rest)!
