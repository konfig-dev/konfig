Ask any developer: do you prefer GraphQL or REST? This often leads to
opinionated conversations, sometimes even devolving into vulgar opinions rather
than objective facts.

To delve into the GraphQL vs. REST debate, I scoured platforms where developers
frequently discuss such matters: YouTube, Reddit, Twitter, and Hacker News. I
parsed 1,000s of discussions and synthesized my findings in this article,
striving to present only thought-provoking perspectives.

<Figure caption='Funnel for gathering through-provoking perspectives'>

</Figure>

Next, I transcribed these discussions onto a whiteboard, organizing them into
"Pro GraphQL," "Pro REST," or "Neutral" categories, and then clustering them
into distinct perspectives. Each section in this post showcases a perspective
while referencing pertinent discussions. To conclude, I highlight blog posts
from GitHub and Shopify that serve as informative case studies in this ongoing
debate.

## Pro REST Perspectives

REST APIs have been around for decades. Much of the world's networking
infrastructure is built on the HTTP standard, so it's no surprise that REST
enjoys substantial support. However, similar to how
[SOAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP) was eventually [overtaken by
REST](https://stackify.com/soap-vs-rest/#:~:text=SOAP%20was%20long%20the%20standard,primary%20differences%20between%20SOAP%20vs.),
GraphQL now poses a challenge to REST. As with any technological shift, there
will always be those who express skepticism.

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

GraphQL is complicated.

A few features that are simple to implement with REST instantly become a huge
pain with GraphQL:

- Access control
- Rate limiting
- Caching
- [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) protection
- Using Maps/Tables/Dictionaries
- [N + 1 Problem](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/97197/what-is-the-n1-selects-problem-in-orm-object-relational-mapping)

The complexity that arises from adopting GraphQL can sometimes outweigh its benefits for most engineering teams.
Does your organization have a substantial budget allocated for engineers?
Is your data model extremely relational? Is
your API catering to a vast user base? Do all your engineers possess a proficient understanding of GraphQL? If not, you probably shouldn't be adopting
GraphQL for its flexible query language.

Entire companies like [Stellate](https://stellate.co/) and
[Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) were born out of the need to solve these arguably over-complicated characteristics of GraphQL.

### Perspective: GraphQL is not an optimization

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

GraphQL is not an automatic performance optimization.

If your team faces similar challenges as Facebook, feel free to focus on
optimizing your API layer. Otherwise, there are likely other optimizations you
can implement for your application beyond the query layer.

Despite its flexible query language, GraphQL can become a performance
bottleneck. Writing a query that slows down your API is quite easy. Tasks like
optimized DB queries, precise access control, query complexity analysis, and
HTTP-level caching are complex to implement and introduce additional overhead to
your server.

GraphQL does not inherently enhance the speed of your API. The responsibility to
optimize your API performance still rests on your shoulders.

## Pro GraphQL Perspectives

Despite the naysayers, GraphQL has still captured the minds of thousands of
developers. The experiences of using GraphQL are undeniable, and it's easy to
see why so many developers are excited about it.

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

Developers prioritize developer experience.

Ask any developer you know; developer experience is the key to unlocking
productivity. The GraphQL community has undoubtedly prioritized developer
experience for users. Check out the [abundant and growing ecosystem of
tools](https://graphql.org/code/) available for free. I'm impressed with [The
Guild](https://the-guild.dev/) and their work on building a comprehensive
GraphQL suite of tools.

From documentation and client generators to data validation, server
implementations, and API gateways, mature open-source projects cover it all. The
caveat is that Node.js/JavaScript is the most popular language for GraphQL,
resulting in differing levels of support for other languages. However, this
situation is rapidly changing.

Because GraphQL mandates the creation of an API schema, unlike REST, code
generation stands out as a prominent feature among most GraphQL technology
stacks. This significantly benefits developers by reducing the amount of
boilerplate code they need to write. The ability to generate code from "front to
back" is a game-changer for rapid development. While the REST ecosystem is
progressing, it took a back seat for many years until [OpenAPI](/blog/openapi)
emerged.

Whether in small or large-scale software systems, GraphQL addresses a crucial
aspect of the developer experience problem like never before. Personally, I
believe this is a significant factor contributing to GraphQL's current traction.
The compelling developer experience offered by GraphQL often leads people to
overlook the tradeoffs.

You can't ignore the use of GraphQL in hyper-scale organizations like Facebook,
GitHub, and Shopify.

There are compelling case studies for the performance of GraphQL in some of the
largest engineering organizations in the world. But it's important to note that
these organizations have the resources to invest in the infrastructure and
engineering talent required to make GraphQL work at scale.

For most organizations, those resources are not available and important to the
immediate business goals. In these cases, GraphQL is not the right choice if you
are purely looking for an optimization.

That being said, I still feel developer experience is a compelling reason to
adopt GraphQL if your team is willing to invest in the learning curve.

## Neutral Perspectives

I think it's important to highlight the neutral perspectives. In my
opinion, these are the ones that hold the most truth in that they acknowledge
the tradeoffs of each approach. They are also the rarest opinions to find since
most developers are stubborn in their ways.

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

GraphQL proves valuable for intricate relational data models and sizable teams
grappling with substantial scalability challenges, but it's not a silver bullet.

GraphQL emerged as a solution to a specific predicament at Facebook: the
migration of the social media giant's newsfeed functionality from web to mobile.
(Read more about it
[here](https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/)).

This perspective may seem apparent and lacking in provocation, yet, as with any engineering choice, trade-offs come into play. Because Facebook has contributed [so many great projects to open
source](https://opensource.fb.com/), it's easy for engineers to blindly adopt
the latest and greatest from Facebook in hopes it will help you preemptively
solve scaling problems. But as always, you have to understand the problem you
are solving to make the right technical decision for your team or you risk
over-engineering your solution.

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

To successfully implement GraphQL at scale, a high level of skill is required to
ensure optimal performance.

In practice, GraphQL provides an exceptional
interface for frontend and API consumers, enabling them to query and explore the
API efficiently. However, it does shift a significant portion of complexity to
the backend. For instance, in the absence of [persisted
queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/),
GraphQL exposes an interface that can be potentially hazardous, allowing
unbounded query requests to your API. Have a public GraphQL API? Then you are forced to rate limit
by calculating [query complexity like
Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/rate-limiting-graphql-apis-calculating-query-complexity).
Without access to skilled engineers and the resources for substantial
infrastructure investment, GraphQL can become a recipe for disaster when it
comes to scalability.

Nonetheless, when executed correctly, GraphQL can bring immense benefits to
client-heavy applications, offering tools like
[GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) for interactive query
exploration, [cache normalization with
urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/) for efficient data
management, and the ability to create granular queries without much hassle.
Without GraphQL, incorporating these features would demand a significant amount
of effort.

REST doesn't share these scalability challenges to the same
extent, as backend developers can pinpoint performance issues to specific
endpoints. Developers can also rely on the mature and well-defined HTTP
specification that existing infrastructure is already equipped to handle.

## Conclusion

<Admonition type="info" title="disclosure">
I run a [developer tools company](https://konfigthis.com) that builds for REST
APIs using the OpenAPI and Postman Collections standards. We use GraphQL internally but I have
incentive to believe REST is a better option in some use cases.
</Admonition>

Before this exercise, I built GraphQL and REST APIs in both toy and production
examples and always leaned towards DX. After reading 1,000s of perspectives, I
am convinced that you should start with REST to avoid the complications of
GraphQL. If you are lucky enough to be making technical decisions at "unicorn
scale", I would consider looking at GraphQL to optimize the query interface.
Meanwhile, take advantage of the [growing OpenAPI
ecosystem](/blog/openapi#openapi-tools-and-ecosystem).

In most cases, for GraphQL to effectively address the problems it was originally
designed to solve, a team should ideally possess a considerable number of
developers, and their API should handle traffic at a "unicorn scale." Most
likely it's not necessary to overly concern yourself with such extensive
scalability, as the complexity involved might not be justified. Notable giants
like Twilio and Stripe, for instance, have not yet integrated GraphQL into their
public APIs despite being well beyond unicorn status.

Nevertheless, if you have a workflow that takes advantage of the remarkable
developer experience offered by GraphQL, then by all means, embrace it! Just
ensure that you are fully aware of the tradeoffs involved. Ultimately, the most
suitable choice for most teams is whatever enables faster development.

Side note: If you are just looking to build fast, checkout
[tRPC](https://trpc.io/) - the DX is pretty awesome. I have no affiliation other
than building a production app using tRPC.
