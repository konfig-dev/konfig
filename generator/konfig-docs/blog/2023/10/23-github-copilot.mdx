GitHub Copilot has recently taken the software engineering world by storm and
just hit a milestone of $100M ARR, which is enough to stand alone as a publicly
listed company. Funding is also pouring into code-focused LLM use cases.

{/* TRUNCATE */}

LLMs are causing a stir in the software engineering community, with some
developers praising the technology and others fearing it. The controversy
surrounding LLMs is so intense that it has even led to a lawsuit against GitHub
Copilot.

To understand how developers are receiving Copilot, I went to where
developers live: Reddit, Twitter, Hacker News, and YouTube. I parsed 1,000s of
discussions and synthesized my findings in this article, striving to present
only thought-provoking opinions.

Next, I transcribed these discussions onto a whiteboard, organizing them into
"Pro Copilot," "Anti Copilot", or "Neutral" categories, and then clustering them
into distinct opinions. Each section in this post showcases an opinion while
referencing pertinent discussions.

## Anti-Copilot Opinions

### Opinion: Copilot produces bad results

LLMs are probabilistic models, which means they are not always correct. This is
especially true for Copilot, which is trained on a corpus of code that may not
be representative of the code that a developer writes. As a result, Copilot can
produce consistently bad results.

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

Developers expect their tools to be reliable.

Copilot is not reliable, and therefore, certain developers have a tough time
wrestling with its output.  For people who worry about job security, fear
nothing, because Copilot is not going to replace you anytime soon.

### Opinion: Copilot creates more problems than solutions

Copilot is a tool that is supposed to help developers write code. However, it
can also create more problems than solutions. Code requires 100% accuracy, and
inaccuracy can lead you down a rabbit hole of debugging. Often wasting time or flat out
breaking your code.

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

Copilot can mess up your code.

In some cases, this is frustrating enough for developers to stop using Copilot
altogether.  Just like managing a junior developer, Copilot requires a lot of
oversight.

## Pro Copilot Opinions

### Opinion: Copilot helps you write software faster

Despite the inaccuracy of LLMs, if you treat Copilot as a tool that can help
take care of the boring stuff, it can be a powerful tool. And a 10-20% increase
in productivity is nothing to scoff at.

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

Copilot increases productivity.

Often time developers are faced with mundane and repetitive tasks. Given enough
context, Copilot can do these tasks for you with sufficient accuracy. For some
developers, these tasks can be a significant time sink, and Copilot can help you
get that time back.

### Opinion: Copilot helps you write better software

Copilot can be a great learning tool for junior developers, giving tech leads
more time to focus on higher-level tasks. Ultimately leading to better software
and happier developers.

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

Copilot has enough intelligence to help you write better software.

This is especially true for junior developers who are still learning the ropes.
It can drastically make mundane tasks like documentation and testing easier,
giving developers more time to focus on the bigger picture while maintaining a
high standard of code quality.

## Neutral Opinions

### Opinion: Copilot is like a calculator

Copilot is a tool that can help you solve problems faster, but it is not a
replacement for your brain. You still need to know how to solve problems, and
you still need to know how to write code.

#### Key Takeaway ðŸ”‘

Similar to how calculators allow mathematicians to solve problems faster,
Copilot keeps developers from worrying about repetitive tasks.

However, just like calculators, Copilot does not help you make sense of the
problem. You still need to know how to solve problems, and you still need to
know how to write code.

# Conclusion

Depending on who you ask, Copilot is either a blessing or a curse. Some
developers love it, while others hate it. For those who praise it,
Copilot is a tool that can help you write code faster and better. For those
who hate it, Copilot is a tool that can create more problems than solutions.

I suspect that the complexity of a task makes a big difference in the quality of
output. Working on tasks that require more context will inevitably lead to worse
results. But if you just treat Copilot as a tool that can help take care of the
boring stuff, it can be a powerful tool.

<Admonition type="info" title="Our opinion">
At [Konfig](https://konfigthis.com), we use Copilot and ChatGPT daily and have
found them to be incredibly useful. We are excited to see what the future holds
for LLMs and are looking forward to using more tools that help developers write
better. We would be very disappointed if we could not use Copilot anymore.
