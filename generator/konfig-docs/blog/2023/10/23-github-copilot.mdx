GitHub Copilot has recently taken the software engineering world by storm and just hit a
[milestone of $100M ARR, which is enough to stand alone as a publicly listed
company](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1711792178031460618?s=46&t=3D8YW9UxdZo4eiYzLsOALw).
[Funding is starting to pour into code-focused LLM
use-cases](https://tabby.tabbyml.com/blog/2023/10/14/seed-round-release-0-3-0-RAG/).

But code-focused LLM product's step function in the state of the art has also
brought with it
[controversy](https://twitter.com/paulinebhyang/status/1711802423474540992) and
funny results.

We pay for GitHub Copilot because we believe it delivers an efficiency boost in
our development workflow that outweighs the cost. But what does the average
developer think about GitHub Copilot? What are the most common complaints? What
are the most common praises?


To understand how developers are receiving Copilot, I went to where
developers live: Reddit, Twitter, Hacker News, and YouTube. I parsed 1,000s of
discussions and synthesized my findings in this article, striving to present
only thought-provoking opinions.

Next, I transcribed these discussions onto a whiteboard, organizing them into
"Pro Copilot," "Anti Copilot", or "Neutral" categories, and then clustering them
into distinct opinions. Each section in this post showcases an opinion while
referencing pertinent discussions.
