## Docs Search <Flame/>

</Figure>

We've added a lightning fast search bar to the docs that allows you to quickly
search for your docs. The search bar is available on the top right of the docs
and has a shortcut of `Ctrl + K` to quickly focus on it (on Mac it's `Cmd + K`).

## Inline SDK Installation Instructions

![Inline Installation Instructions](./changelog-8-assets/installation.png)

We've added a new installation instructions section to the docs that allows you
to quickly copy the SDK installation instructions for a language. This makes it
easier for developers to get started with your SDKs by reducing the friction of
finding the SDK installation instructions.


## Google Analytics Support

You can now add your Google Analytics ID to your docs configuration and we'll
automatically add the Google Analytics script to your docs. See the full instructions for
adding Google Analytics to your docs [here](/docs/portal/tutorials/configuring-google-analytics).
