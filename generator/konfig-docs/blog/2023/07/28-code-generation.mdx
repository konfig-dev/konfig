Code generation is ubiquitous in software engineering, it exists in literally
every part of the stack from programming languages to the websites we browse. So
why is code generation everywhere? **Because code generation empowers
developers**. By automating tasks and creating simpler abstractions, code
generation makes developers more productive and less error-prone.

At [C3.ai](https://c3.ai/), I worked on a [tool that leverages code
generation](https://c3.ai/what-is-enterprise-ai/it-for-enterprise-ai/c3-ai-type-system/)
to build enterprise AI applications. At the same time, I became deeply immersed
in the art of code generation by building the tooling myself. Since then, I
enjoy learning about code-generation technologies across the entire software
stack from programming languages to AI assistants.

![Code Generation Mindmap](/img/code-generation.png)

### Why generate code?

Code generation is the automated process of producing code from a high-level
representation. Code generation tools parse input data to produce target code in
programming languages. The most notable high-level representation are programming languages themselves.

![Code Generation Flow](/img/code-generation-flow.png)

When the first electrical computers were created, physical switches were used to
program computers. Physical switches are extremely error-prone and
time-consuming to operate. So with the invention of the CPU and instruction
sets, the first form of a programming language was invented, assembly.

<Figure caption='Example of a "Hello, World!" program in Intel x86 assembly language.'>
```x86 hello_world.X86
section .data
    hello db 'Hello, World!',0xA
    hello_len equ $ - hello

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; syscall to print the message
    mov eax, 4          ; sys_write syscall number
    mov ebx, 1          ; file descriptor (stdout)
    mov ecx, hello      ; pointer to the message
    mov edx, hello_len  ; message length
    int 0x80

    ; syscall to exit the program
    mov eax, 1          ; sys_exit syscall number
    xor ebx, ebx        ; exit status (0 = success)
    int 0x80
```
</Figure>

Assembly is a linear series of instructions for the computer to execute.
Assembly is used to generate the lowest level of instructions for computers,
[machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code).

<Admonition type="tip" title="Can you believe this?">
The classic amusement park simulator [RollerCoaster Tycoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon) was [written using assembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_(video_game)#:~:text=The%20game%20was%20developed%20in,one%20percent%20written%20in%20C.).
</Admonition>

But still, assembly code is tedious and error-prone to write so programming
languages that generate to assembly were invented. Here is the same "Hello,
World!" program written in popular programming languages.

<CH.Code>
```cpp C++
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello, World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

```javascript JavaScript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

```python Python
print("Hello, World!")
```

```go Go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
```java Java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
</CH.Code>

After comparing the "Hello, World!" program in assembly to the ones written in
higher-level programming languages, it's clear that code generation empowers
developers to be 100x more productive when building applications. If you think
about it, software engineering is simply operating code generators to produce
performant machine code ðŸ¤¯.

[Compilers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) are the code generators that power programming languages. Compilers turn a source
language into a target language. In practice, most computer languages target
assembly code in instruction sets such as
[x86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_instruction_listings) and
[ARM](https://iitd-plos.github.io/col718/ref/arm-instructionset.pdf), but others
like Java target their [own instruction
set](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html). Some
programming languages compile to other programming languages such as
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to
[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript).


<Admonition type="tip" title="Fun fact">
Compilers themselves are typically written in the programming
language
itself. This concept is called [bootstrapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_(compilers)#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20bootstrapping%20is,that%20it%20intends%20to%20compile.).
</Admonition>

Nowadays, compilers are so advanced that there is rarely a reason to
write pure assembly code. In most cases, writing applications in a programming
language leads to faster programs than writing programs in assembly due to
amazing compiler infrastructures like [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and
[LLVM](https://llvm.org/).


<Admonition type="note" title="Interesting Topic">

programming](https://youtu.be/bVJ-mWWL7cE).  The video covers an example of why
in some cases you need to know exactly how programming languages work to beat
the compiler.

### Database Code Generation

One code-generation pattern that has found a lot of traction is
in [Object-Relational Mapping
(ORM)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping).

![ORM](/img/orm.png)

For context, databases define a [domain-specific
language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) that allows
them to build a generic execution engine for querying data. Databases can then
optimize the execution engine while still providing a flexible interface for
querying data.  Today the most common type of query language for databases is
SQL (aka Structured query language).  But SQL is tedious to read and write,
especially if you have to write many read or write operations to a database in a
single codebase.

<Figure caption="An example SQL query for employees over the age of 30">
```sql query.sql
SELECT id, name, age, department
FROM employees
WHERE age > 30
ORDER BY name;
```
</Figure>

Enter Prisma, an [extremely popular library with 33k stars on
GitHub](https://github.com/prisma/prisma) for building applications that
interact with a database like [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) or
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). Prisma is an ORM that leverages code
generation to allow developers to easily use databases by generating database
migration queries in SQL and type-safe clients to interact with the database.

<Figure src="/img/prisma.png" caption={<div>Source: <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">prisma.io</a></div>}/>

Take for example a TypeScript function that makes two simple queries and returns
the data. With Prisma, we can convert plain-text SQL statements to typed
function calls and delete over 50% of the code.

<Figure src="/img/with-prisma.png" caption="The same function for querying a database in TypeScript using plain-text SQL statements (Left) and Prisma (Right)"/>

Prisma is relatively new but its superior developer experience allows developers
to move fast without breaking things. Unsurprisingly, Prisma has found itself as
a fan favorite amongst Node.js developers, quickly beating out existing ORMs.

<Figure src="/img/prisma-vs-sequelize.png" caption={<div>Despite only appearing
in 2019, Prisma is rapidly beating out <a href="https://github.com/sequelize/sequelize">Sequelize</a>, a much older ORM for Node.js (Source: <a
href="https://star-history.com/#sequelize/sequelize&prisma/prisma&Date">star-history.com</a>)</div>}/>

Other modern ORMs like [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/) recognize the benefits
of code generation in delivering a great developer experience and [are actively
integrating code generation capabilities into their
ORM](https://www.edgedb.com/docs/changelog/3_x#client-libraries).

<Figure src="/img/edgedb.png" caption={<div>Source: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.edgedb.com/">edgedb.com</a></div>}/>

By taking database interactions to a higher level, Prisma and EdgeDB hope to
build an intelligent layer over SQL that can produce queries that would take a
human hours or even days to craft. But in general, ORMs like Prisma and EdgeDB
leverage code generation to fulfill an ongoing pursuit of more efficient,
developer-friendly, and maintainable solutions for database interactions in
modern software development.

### Web Application Code Generation

Web application technologies have existed since the dawn of [Web
2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0). In parallel, frameworks for
building web applications have found traction amongst developers. This is
because web frameworks abstract or automate the tedious code needed to build
full-stack applications.

[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), which has been used to build giant tech companies such as
[Shopify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shopify#:~:text=used%20the,of%20development.)
and
[GitHub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub#:~:text=The%20GitHub%20Service,on%20Rails),
is famous for tooling that automates the tedious work when building a full-stack application. Rails does this by providing a
[CLI](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html) for
generating commonly used code while developing.

<Figure src="/img/ruby-on-rails.png" caption={<div>Source: <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">rubyonrails.org</a></div>}/>

For example, if you wanted to create a blog as a Rails application, you would simply
run:

```bash Terminal
rails new blog
```

The CLI will then set up all the boilerplate code to start developing your web
application in Rails under the `blog/` folder. The `rails` CLI also offers [code generation for tests,
database migrations, models, and more](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#bin-rails-generate). Code generation with Rails saves
developers hours of setup and maintenance work. Teams of developers also move
faster with code generation by enforcing best practices within the generators
themselves.

<Admonition type="note" title="other examples">
[RedwoodJS](https://redwoodjs.com/), a full-stack framework built on top of
modern web technologies like GraphQL, TypeScript, and Prisma, leverages code
generation to generate UI components in the form of
[cells](https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cells#generating-a-cell).

<Figure src="/img/redwoodjs.png" caption={<div>Source: <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/">redwoodjs.com</a></div>}/>

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), the Python project powering products
like Instagram, leverages code generation to [generate database
migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/ref/django-admin/#django-admin-makemigrations).

<Figure src="/img/django.png" caption={<div>Source: <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">djangoproject.com</a></div>}/>

</Admonition>

Another use case for code generation appears in the latest front-end framework
for browsers, [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/). Svelte disrupts front-end
frameworks such as [React](https://react.dev/) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) by
introducing a compiler that drastically improves the developer experience when
building complex front-end applications.

<Figure src="/img/svelte.png" caption={<div>Source: <a href="https://svelte.dev/">svelte.dev</a></div>}/>

The main benefits of the Svelte compiler are reduced bundle sizes, performant
front-end code, and improved developer experience. For example, here is a simple
web page written in Svelte that displays how many times a button was clicked.

```svelte index.svelte
<script>
  let count = 0;

  function increment() {
    count += 1;
  }
</script>

<main>
  <h1>Reactivity in Svelte</h1>
  <p>Count: {count}</p>
  <button on:click={increment}>Increment</button>
</main>
```

<CH.Section>

The same web page written in React has additional import statements and
boilerplate code from setting up a functional component and state.

```jsx index.jsx focus=1,3,4,10,16,17,19
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function ReactiveReact() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function increment() {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Reactivity in React</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default ReactiveReact;
```
</CH.Section>

The simplicity of Svelte is made possible by its compiler. By adding a code
generation layer at build time, Svelte can provide a clean interface for
building front ends while maintaining reactivity and state management
functionality.

<Figure src="/img/svelte-compiler.png" caption={<div>The <a href="https://svelte.dev/repl/hello-world?version=4.1.2">Svelte REPL</a> showing the input file (left) and the compiled JavaScript output (right)</div>}/>

### API Code Generation

Adjacent to web applications are APIs, which [can be
really
complex](/blog/what-is-an-sdk#why-do-developers-need-help-integrating-apis).
But code generation drastically simplifies API integrations by generating boilerplate code and
client libraries. Network protocols such as [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/),
[gRPC](https://grpc.io/), and [OpenAPI](/blog/openapi) not only
streamline API development but also leverage code generation to create
server-side scaffolding and client-side SDKs, enhancing API consistency and
reducing complexity.

GraphQL has found a lot of traction when building front-end applications due to
its self-documenting workflow and flexibility for front-ends to query for only
necessary data. Developers can generate clients for a GraphQL API to remove any
boilerplate code and enforce type safety. For example given the simple GraphQL
schema for a `User` model and a `getUser` query.

```graphql schema.graphql
type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
}

type Query {
  getUser(id: ID!): User
}
```

We can leverage
[graphql-code-generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator)
to generate type-safe query hooks in React. Notice that we simply import the
query and pass in the necessary variable, `userId`. No need to manually
construct an HTTP request, serialize a request body or deserialize a response
body.

```jsx focus=2,5,20:25
import React from 'react';
import { useGetUserQuery } from '../generated/graphql';

const UserComponent = ({ userId }) => {
  const { loading, error, data } = useGetUserQuery({ variables: { userId } });

  if (loading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  const user = data?.getUser;

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>User Information</h2>
      {user && (
        <div>
          <p>Name: {user.name}</p>
          <p>Email: {user.email}</p>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserComponent;
```

For gRPC, communication happens between two backend systems so code is
generated for a server-side language such as Python. Using the same `User`
example in GraphQL, the `.proto` file for `gRPC` is the following.

```proto user_service.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package user;

service UserService {
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (UserResponse) {}
}

message GetUserRequest {
  int32 user_id = 1;
}

message UserResponse {
  int32 id = 1;
  string name = 2;
  string email = 3;
}
```

Using [grpcio-tools](https://pypi.org/project/grpcio-tools/) to generate a
client in Python we can write the following code to communicate with the
`UserService`.

```python make_request.py focus=11:15
import grpc
import user_service_pb2
import user_service_pb2_grpc

def run_grpc_client():
    channel = grpc.insecure_channel('localhost:50051')
    client = user_service_pb2_grpc.UserServiceStub(channel)

    try:
        user_id = 1
        request = user_service_pb2.GetUserRequest(user_id=user_id)
        response = client.GetUser(request)
        print(f"User ID: {response.id}")
        print(f"Name: {response.name}")
        print(f"Email: {response.email}")

    except grpc.RpcError as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    run_grpc_client()

```

In OpenAPI, communication is typically between a third-party developer and a
public API such as [Stripe](https://stripe.com/). Using the same `User` example
again we can define the following OpenAPI.

```yaml api.yaml
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Sample API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /users/{user_id}:
    get:
      summary: Get user by ID
      parameters:
        - name: user_id
          in: path
          required: true
          schema:
            type: integer
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Successful response
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/User'
components:
  schemas:
    User:
      type: object
      properties:
        id:
          type: integer
        name:
          type: string
        email:
          type: string
```

And use [openapi-generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator)
to generate a publishable client SDK in Python.

```python make_request.py focus=11:14
from python_client.api_client import ApiClient
from python_client.api.default_api import DefaultApi

def get_user_by_id(user_id):
    configuration = Configuration()

    api_client = ApiClient(configuration)
    api_instance = DefaultApi(api_client)

    try:
        response = api_instance.get_user_by_id(user_id)
        print(f"User ID: {response.id}")
        print(f"Name: {response.name}")
        print(f"Email: {response.email}")

    except ApiException as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    get_user_by_id(1)  # Replace '1' with the desired user ID
```

In all three examples, generated client SDKs remove unnecessary code to
construct an HTTP request or handle serialization and deserialization.
Furthermore, any unexpected data errors are caught during development time.  As
the number of operations and data models grows, the same code generation tooling
can be used to ensure consistency throughout any API integrations.

### When not to use Code Generation?

Like everything in engineering, there are tradeoffs. Even though code generation
is powerful, generating code adds a layer of complexity that is not always
warranted.  In some cases, it does not make sense to generate code as it slows
the development process or the same effect can be achieved more simply.
Compilers are not simple; the [LLVM has over 400,000
commits](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) for a good reason. Compilers
essentially treat written code as data so imagine how complex the [ASTs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) and
program flows can be.

An example of when code generation should not be used is when building a data
validation library for TypeScript or Python.  You could theoretically generate
data validation code from a standard specification such as [JSON
Schema](https://json-schema.org/).  But languages like TypeScript and Python
already come prepared with the typing functionality.  Instead, we should re-use
the typing functionality to create our data validation library. Popular examples
of non-code-generation-based data validation libraries include
[zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) for TypeScript or
[pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic) for Python.

To use these libraries, no compilation step is necessary which means they can be
imported at any time and used in any runtime. But in some cases, where process
boundaries are crossed such as web APIs, data validation is not possible to
achieve without code generation; hence the use of code generation in network
protocols like GraphQL, gRPC, and OpenAPI.

### AI Assistants

The latest form of code generation looks completely different than previous
generations. Instead of domain-specific toolings like how ORMs generate SQL, AI
assistants define a whole new input and output model. In particular, products
such as [CodePilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and
[Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/) live inside of a developer's IDE, generating
contextual code from the currently open files.

<Figure src="/img/github-copilot.png" caption={<div>Demonstration of AI-generated code inside the IDE (Source: <a href="https://github.com/features/copilot">github.com/features/copilot</a>)</div>}/>

What do I mean by contextual code? This time, instead of providing a standard
input format such as a programming language or API specification, the input
format is simply the surrounding code in the open files. A suggested completion
is predicted based on the context and offered as a tab-completion in the IDE.
Since LLMs are [probability-based
models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model#Output), its
usefulness revolves entirely around prediction accuracy.

A probability model works out great in this context because the generated code
can be assessed by a human and there is virtually no risk when the suggestion is
wrong. And it truly feels like your development workflow is being "augmented" as
opposed to being replaced.

But these products introduce a new complexity. Microsoft even published a video
guide on ["Prompting with
Copilot"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ImWfIDTxn7E), to help you be more
effective while using Copilot. One tip from the video is to write a comment like
`# Description: The file processes a JSON` at the top of a Python file to give
Copilot more context. Writing extraneous comments is not typical so developers
have to be aware of these nuances to properly prompt the AI.

Since everything is probability-based, providing enough context for the AI is
crucial to improve its accuracy. But sometimes prompt engineering can take more
time and effort than simply writing the code. When lots of context is required,
which is often the case in larger codebases, the accuracy of the AI drops which
can then lead to misleading or incorrect suggestions.
[Magic](https://magic.dev/) recognizes this limitation and is on a mission to
solve it. But despite these complexities, AI shows a lot of immediate value when
properly used.


### Final Thoughts on AI

Over time, we have engineered ourselves into [higher and higher levels of
abstraction to build performant software](https://www.modular.com/mojo). From
low-level assembly to AI assistants, compilers and code generation has proven to
be a major productivity multiplier for software engineers. And with the most
recent advancements in AI, we find ourselves asking, "Is natural language the
final form of programming?". At Konfig, we leave the answer up to practical
experimentation. After all, if a rules-based engine can be outperformed by LLMs,
why spend thousands of engineering hours building one?

I believe completion-based assistants have strong fit in the software
development lifecycle, but LLMs just don't cut it when you need 100% accuracy.
Where I see AI falling short is when 100% accuracy is expected. Although [some
are choosing to go all-in on AI-based code
generation](https://blog.darklang.com/gpt/). But I am always open to the
possibility of being wrong and would happily delete our entire codebase if AI
can solve the problem.
