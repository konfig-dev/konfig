[OpenAPI](/blog/openapi) makes it really easy to generate documentation for your API. There are a
number of open source and paid solutions that make it easy to generate
documentation for your API. To find out which solution is best for you, we
researched and compared the best open source and paid OpenAPI documentation
generators.

generator, then you should consider using one of the following open source
solutions. Open Source solutions are always free and usually highly
customizable.

| Plugin | GitHub | NPM |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [docusaurus-openapi](https://github.com/cloud-annotations/docusaurus-openapi) | [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/cloud-annotations/docusaurus-openapi)](https://github.com/cloud-annotations/docusaurus-openapi) | [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/docusaurus-plugin-openapi.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-preset-openapi) |
| [docusaurus-openapi-docs](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs) | [![GitHub Repo stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs)](https://github.com/PaloAltoNetworks/docusaurus-openapi-docs) | [![npm downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/docusaurus-plugin-openapi-docs) |

Docusaurus is an open-source, static site generator developed by Facebook's
team, built on React, and suitable for teams publishing documentation.

If you are already using Docusaurus, there are two plugins for Docusaurus for generating OpenAPI documentation:

<Carousel.Wrapper>
<Carousel.Slide>
    <Figure caption="docusaurus-openapi">
    ![docusaurus-openapi](generating-openapi-documentation-assets/docusaurus-openapi.png)
    </Figure>
</Carousel.Slide>
<Carousel.Slide>
    <Figure caption="docusaurus-openapi-docs">
    ![docusaurus-openapi-docs](generating-openapi-documentation-assets/docusaurus-openapi-docs.gif)
    </Figure>
</Carousel.Slide>
</Carousel.Wrapper>


Both plugins are nearly equivalent in terms of feature set. We personally like
the UI/UX of `docusaurus-openapi-docs` better but `docusaurus-openapi` has more
stars on GitHub. We suggest you try both and see which one you like better or simply works
better for your OpenAPI specification.

#### Pros

- Git-based
- Free and open-source
- Highly customizable
- Configurable layout/navigation
- SEO optimized
- Supports blog posts
- Supports MDX and JSX.
- Generates static code Snippets for making API requests
- Great search integrations with Algolia or offline search
- Rich Plugin Ecosystem
- Supports multiple versions of your API
- Supports custom documentation with Markdown

#### Cons

- Requires technical resources for installation and maintenance.
- Can be costly in terms of technical expertise to setup and maintain
- UI/UX for OpenAPI plugins is not as polished as paid solutions
- Needs a secure proxy to enable interactive requests in the browser

## Paid (Monthly Fee)

If the open source solutions are not a good fit for you, then you should
consider using one of the following paid solutions. Paid solutions are usually
hosted and maintained by the company that created them. This means that you
don't have to worry about installation and maintenance. Paid solutions are
usually more feature rich and have better UI/UX than open source solutions.

### [Redocly](https://redocly.com/)

## Our Opinion

If you are looking for a free and open source solution, we recommend using
[Elements](https://github.com/stoplightio/elements) as it has the best UI/UX and
is the most feature rich of the open source solutions.

If you are already
using a server framework like [Spring
Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) or
[Express](https://expressjs.com/), then you should consider using [Swagger
UI](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui) as there are already integrations
for these frameworks.

If you are already using [Docusaurus](/blog/penapi-documentation-generators#plugins-for-docusaurus), then you should consider using one of the two
plugins for Docusaurus.

If you are in the market for a paid solution.
