Our mobile phones are a ubiquitous part of our lives, so it’s no surprise that companies find them useful when they want to send us messages from PIN codes to verify our identity to marketing messages to food delivery updates. As more companies (tech and otherwise) want to send us messages, messaging APIs have popped up to make adding this feature as easy and seamless as possible. 

## What are Messaging APIs?

Messaging APIs allow companies to automatically or manually send messages to their customers via SMS, MMS, Whatsapp, push notifications, etc. In addition to just sending messages, messaging APIs also offer other services like analytics to help companies understand their users and optimize their messages.

## Why are Messaging APIs useful?

Messaging APIs are useful because they allow companies to reach users at scale in a way that will be noticed. Messages that can cut through the noise of everyday life are very useful in driving business outcomes, e.g. getting a notification about a sale can drive conversion for an e-commerce business. Some common use cases for messaging APIs include:
- Identity verification whether through sending one time passwords to users who forgot their password, PIN codes for two factor authorization, etc. Identity verification helps users conveniently manage their accounts and helps companies avoid fraud.
- Programmable messages whether marketing messages, promotions, notifications (food delivery, flights), etc. 
- Conversational messages (e.g. chatbots) for customer support.

## Final Thoughts

If you’re looking to introduce messaging services into your product, then it’s important to choose a provider that serves your needs. Some important things to consider are:
- What use cases do I have for messaging (identity verification vs. marketing vs. delivery, etc)? 
- What geographies and carriers do I need access to?
- What level of message customization and targeting do I need?
- Are there other ancillary messaging and communication services I want to provide and do I want to use the same provider?
