# The 8 Best Workflow Builder APIs in 2024

Business process automation is crucial in today’s fast-paced digital world. Increasingly, businesses need custom products tailored to their specific needs, as well as integrations with their own internal systems or third-party applications. This demand accounts for the rise of workflow builder companies, which allow their customers to automate custom processes to increase efficiency, speed, cost, and reduce human error. In this article, we’ll explore the best workflow builder companies and what they offer.

## What are Workflow APIs?

A workflow builder is a SaaS product which (usually) offers a drag and drop interface that allows for automation of business processes. Users can define a sequence of steps, connected in a graph, which are performed by the software when the workflow is triggered. Workflows can be triggered by any event from the opening of a GitHub pull request, to the arrival of an email, or even just at a certain time every day. Workflow builders typically offer an API which can interact with defined workflows, such as triggering runs, checking their status, or retrieving results.

## Why are Workflow APIs useful?

Workflows allow a variety of different custom business processes to be automated by software, which improves speed, efficiency, and reduces the potential for human error. The drag and drop interfaces of workflow builders allow automation processes to be created with little to no code, giving non-engineers accessibility to create and operate them, and making the processes observable, understandable, and reproducible. Many workflows also offer integration with other systems and applications, allowing any customer to build bespoke applications tailored to their needs.
