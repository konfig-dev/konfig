## What are News Aggregation APIs?

News Integration APIs provide access to articles, headlines, and other pieces of content from a variety of sources. While the New York Times provides access to their own content via API, news aggregators will provide access  to many sources of news from the New York Times to the Washington Post to Bloomberg via a single API connection. 

## Why are Universal Brokerage Integration APIs useful?

Being able to receive and parse through information is useful to both individuals and businesses. From a business perspective, news aggregation APIs help for the following functions:
 - **Business & Risk intelligence:** Companies are able to stay up to date with current events in their industry, regulatory changes, competitor launches and other risk factors 
 - **Sales Intelligence:** Companies can stay up to date with what potential customers are doing, helping them decide when might be the right time to approach the prospect and what the right message might be

On the consumer side, news aggregation APIs can also be useful for apps who are looking to provide news updates as part of a broader offering of services. Robinhood is a good example of this where they show financial news relevant to a company on that company’s stock page. 

Finally, while news aggregation APIs are generally useful in the same way that [other universal APIs are useful](https://konfigthis.com/blog/asset-management-integrations/) (TL; DR: they save developer time writing integration code with multiple sources and data formats), they are also easier to use and more reliable than scraping thousands of news websites yourself.

## Final Thoughts

If you’re looking to introduce news or news analysis into your workflow, then it’s important to choose a provider that serves your needs. Some important things to consider are:

- What coverage of news articles do I need?
- What latency do I need in receiving news?
- What other ancillary products and services do I need for my workflow and do I want them from the same provider?
