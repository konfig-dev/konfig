It's been a fast start to the year and we are excited to bring you some new
features and improvements to Konfig.

## AI-Generated Operation IDs

![useAIForOperationID](./changelog-10-assets/useAIForOperationId.png)

[`konfig fix`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/konfig-cli#konfig-fix) now has a new option `--useAIForOperationID` that
allows you to use AI to generate meaningful operation IDs for your OpenAPI
specification.

As part of ensuring your OpenAPI specification is high-quality, it is important
to write meaningful [operation
IDs](https://swagger.io/specification/#operationId).  Operation IDs are used as
method names in the generated SDKs. Konfig follows a [strict convention for
naming your operation ID](/docs/tutorials/naming-operation-ids). However, we
understand that it can be a bit of a hassle to come up with these names.
Furthermore, if you have a large OpenAPI spec, it can be a time-consuming task
to name each operation ID. Now you can use AI to automate this process.

## OpenAPI Specification 3.1 Support

![openapi31](./changelog-10-assets/openapi31.png)

Konfig now supports OpenAPI Specification 3.1 ðŸŽ‰!

OpenAPI Specification 3.1 is the latest version of the OpenAPI Specification. It
brought a few new features and improvements over the previous version, 3.0.x,
but also introduced some breaking changes.

Particularly in 3.1, you can specify `nullable` by specifying the `null` keyword
in the `type` field. This is a breaking change from 3.0.x where `nullable` was a
separate field.
