Happy New Year ðŸŽ‰! We are super excited to bring you Konfig Changelog #9. We have made some
improvements to the Docs Portal, fixed some security vulnerabilities and improved the Python SDK.

## Docs Portal Support for iframes

![iframe support](./changelog-9-assets/iframe.png)

We've added support for embedding an `iframe` from sites such as YouTube,
allowing you to embed videos, maps, and more into your portal.

## Security Fixes

![security fixes](./changelog-9-assets/security.png)

We fixed a security vulnerability in our Python and TypeScript SDKs:

1. Upgraded `aiohttp` from `3.8.4` to `3.9.1` in Python SDK
2. Upgraded `axios` from `0.27.2` to `1.6.4` in TypeScript SDK

Note that both these changes are backward incompatible so if you already have
SDKs with Konfig, we have put these upgrades behind a feature flag so you can
upgrade at your own pace.

## Improved Python SDK Type Hints

Type hints in Python used to only previously work in PyCharm but now they work in VSCode as well.

## Check Out Our New Blog Posts!

We published two new blog posts:

1. [I Reviewed 1,000s of Opinions on gRPC](/blog/grpc)

<Figure caption="A fun read!">

</Figure>

These are always fun to write because I get to learn more about the general
sentiment of technology and deepen my understanding of different technologies.

2. [How To Implement Free, Fast, Local Search Using Fuse.js with Next.js SSR](/blog/how-to-implement-free-fast-local-search-with-fuse-js-with-next-js-ssr)

<Figure caption="A technical read!">
![search](../../2023/12/implementing-search-assets/banner.png)
</Figure>

To implement search functionality in Konfig's Docs Portal, we had to solve a
really interesting problem around how to implement search in a Next.js app that
is statically generated. This blog post goes into detail on how we solved this
problem.
