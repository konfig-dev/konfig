In this changelog, we're excited to announce the release of the revamped Ruby,
PHP, and Swift SDKs. We've also made a change to the TypeScript SDKs to use
`pnpm` instead of `yarn` or `npm`. This change has improved the reliability and
performance of our TypeScript SDKs.

Furthermore, we've made several improvements and fixes to the Konfig's SDKs.
These include various bug fixes, better documentation, security vulnerability
fixes, and more rigorous testing for PHP, Python, Ruby, Go, TypeScript, and
Swift SDKs.

## Revamped Ruby, PHP, and Swift SDKs

![Revamped SDKs](./changelog-11-assets/revamped-sdks.png)

We've revamped the Ruby, PHP, and Swift SDKs to be more consistent with the
quality of our Python and TypeScript SDKs.  This includes:

- Improved code quality
- Better test coverage
- Better documentation

In particular, we removed the array of `.md` files that were generated as
documentation and replaced it with the singular `README.md` file that includes
everything you need to know about the SDK. Putting everything on one page makes
it easier to navigate and find what you need.

<Figure caption={<p><b>README.md</b> now includes a branded header, getting started instructions, and a reference section with documentation for every operation in the SDK. This screenshot was taken from <a href="https://github.com/passiv/snaptrade-sdks/tree/master/sdks/typescript#readme">SnapTrade's TypeScript SDK</a> which served as a template for all revamped SDKs.</p>}>

## Konfig's TypeScript SDKs now use `pnpm`

![pnpm](./changelog-11-assets/pnpm.png)

Based on internal quality assurance and integration tests that we regularly run
on our SDKs, we've found that `pnpm` is a better fit for our TypeScript SDKs.
It's faster, more reliable, and uses less disk space than `npm` or `yarn`.  The
breaking point for us was concurrency bugs that were not fixable while using
`yarn`. When switching to `pnpm`, we found that these issues were resolved
without special configuration. This change allowed us to fix flaky tests and
continually ensure our generator was working as expected.
