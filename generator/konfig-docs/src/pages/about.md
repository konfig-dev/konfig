# About

Konfig is a developer tools company; we build API tooling based off the [OpenAPI
Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) and [Postman Collection Format](https://learning.postman.com/collection-format/getting-started/overview/) standards.

## The Problem

Onboarding customers for API-first companies is difficult because APIs are
complicated and time-consuming to integrate.

## The Solution

We generate SDKs, Docs, and Demos/Tutorials for APIs so developers can integrate any API while writing as
few lines of code as possible.

## The Team

We are a passionate team of 3 people.

    and trade ETFs. There, he went through the pain of integrating with APIs and
