### Recap

In this tutorial, we learned about the benefits of SDKs, generated an SDK from
scratch, and refactored an implementation using the generated SDK ðŸŽ‰.

### Further Reading

When doing this on a real API you will need to make modifications to your
OpenAPI Specification to generate high-quality SDKs. Konfig also makes this easy
through its [lint](/docs/tutorials/setup-linting) and
[fix](/docs/tutorials/fix-openapi-spec) utilities. You also want to setup
Continuous Deployment through [GitHub
Action](/docs/tutorials/automate-sdk-updates#github-action) or
[polling](/docs/tutorials/automate-sdk-updates#polling). And sometimes it's also
necessary to add business logic in the SDKs which is also made easy by Konfig
through our [support for customization](/docs/custom-sdks).
