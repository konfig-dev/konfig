### Refactored Implementation

We refactored `make-request.ts` to use the SDK you generated.

```typescript make-request.ts
import { Petstore } from "petstore";

new Petstore().store.placeOrder({
    quantity: "1,000"
}).then(response => {
    console.log("Place Order Response:", response.data);
})
```

<CH.Section>
To [build the SDK](focus://1[1:11]) and [run the refactored implementation](focus://1[16:32]), execute the following command.

```shell Terminal
konfig test && yarn make-request
```
</CH.Section>

This time, we caught an error at compile time that tells us `quantity` should be a number.

```shell Terminal
make-request.ts:5:5 - error TS2322: Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

5     quantity: '1,000',
      ~~~~~~~~

  typescript/dist/models/order.d.ts:34:5
    34     'quantity'?: number;
           ~~~~~~~~~~
    The expected type comes from property 'quantity' which is declared here on type 'Order'
```

Fixing the compilation error should let us make the request.
