### The Solution: Konfig

Konfig is a tool for generating SDKs for your API from the [OpenAPI
Specification](https://swagger.io/specification/) and [Postman Collection
Format](https://schema.postman.com/collection/json/v2.1.0/draft-07/collection.json)

To generate SDKs, we created a [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/konfig-cli)
which has been installed in your development environment.

To control how the SDKs are generated, we created a file type called
`konfig.yaml`. This file specifies things such as target languages or SDK
versions.
