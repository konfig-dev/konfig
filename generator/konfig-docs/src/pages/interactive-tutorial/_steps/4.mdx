### Create a `konfig.yaml`

Run the following command in the terminal.

 ```shell Terminal
 konfig init
 ```


You will be prompted to specify what languages to generate SDKs in.

![Language Prompt](/img/language-prompt.png)

For this demo, we will only generate a TypeScript SDK. Type `a` to de-select all
languages. Then use the down arrow and `space` to select `TypeScript`. Press
`enter` to proceed.

Next, you will be prompted with a few questions on how to [name your SDK package](focus://1),
[the Git repository details](focus://2:3), and [path to your OpenAPI Specification file](focus://4).

You can use the following answers for this tutorial:

```shell Terminal focus=1[37:44],2[29:36],3[37:49],4[47:54]
? What is the SDK package name? ... petstore
? What is your Git user ID? petstore
? What is your Git repository name? petstore-sdks
? What is the relative path to your spec? ... api.yaml
```
