Our highly efficient API helps brands, platforms and third-party logistics providers drive efficiency and cost savings through a network of 70-plus carriers worldwide. You can invest significant resources into building carrier and order source integrations. And, after those integrations are built, you can continue exhausting resources to maintain them. Many businesses choose this expensive, time-intensive path — only to realize the approach is unsustainable.\n\nThere's a better alternative: Integrate once with ShipEngine and never worry about building or maintaining integrations again. Spend your team's valuable time and money on projects that are core to growing your business, rather than dealing with legacy carrier integrations. In addition to the ROI you achieve after implementing ShipEngine, our shipping API also offers pre-negotiated, discounted rates through the USPS, UPS and DHL. Our users report that shipping-related tasks that once took minutes now take seconds, and that ShipEngine's features and capabilities help unlock thousands in savings.\n\nGetting started with ShipEngine is easy.\n\nVisit our API documentation and start building with our SDKs at shipengine.com/docs/\n\nSchedule time to talk to one of our shipping experts by visiting shipengine.com/contact/\n\nOr get a free API key and start building, no credit card required, at shipengine.com/signup/",

They created FreeAgent out of the frustration that doing the books was just too damn difficult for most of us. So they put their heads together and decided that there must be a better way to deal with their mounting piles of invoices, spreadsheets and receipts.\n\nSince our first hire back in 2008, we've also worked hard to make FreeAgent a ✨great✨ place to work.  We've grown to over 250 employees and we continue to build a diverse, high-performing, happy and collaborative team.\n\nIn early 2018,  the company was acquired by the NatWest Group. Our growth has been given a turbo boost, yet we remain operationally independent of the group. 🚀\n\nToday, FreeAgent helps over 150,000 users take care of their finances - from the daily admin to big-picture planning - and do it all happily and successfully.

Consumer expectations of how they're known and treated by brands has never been greater. At the same time brands are under pressure to do more with less and must balance the tension between saving money with AI and automation, while still delivering world-class experiences for consumers. The right experiences create connection, loyalty and customer lifetime value.\n\nCustomer service software built on tickets fails to navigate this tension. And brands who rely on ticketing software are failing in this new economy. Bloated tech stacks. Duplicate tickets. Consumer repetition and frustration. Fumbling and flustered agents. Two bad service experiences will lose a customer for life.\n\nGladly applies AI differently, to help commerce brands deliver radically personal, concierge-level customer service at scale. With Gladly, consumers help themselves when they want and customer service agents are made into superheroes, gaining efficiency and productivity. Every conversation in Gladly starts with a real-time understanding of the customer -- who they are, their preferences, their conversation and purchase history with the brand, every interaction in one place. And with every channel built-in natively - VOICE, email, SMS, chat, social messaging, self-service – brands have one, lifelong conversation stream with their customers.\n\nGladly's customers are the world's most loved brands -- Allbirds, Bombas, Crate & Barrel, Deckers, Eddie Bauer, FTD, Nordstrom, REI, Ulta Beauty, and Warby Parker. These brands and hundreds more leverage Gladly to build lifelong loyal customers through deep connections.\n\nMake customer service your business with Gladly.",
