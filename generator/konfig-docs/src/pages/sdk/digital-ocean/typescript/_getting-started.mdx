     * ## OAuth Authentication
     * 
     * In order to interact with the DigitalOcean API, you or your application must
     * authenticate.
     * 
     * The DigitalOcean API handles this through OAuth, an open standard for
     * authorization. OAuth allows you to delegate access to your account in full
     * or in read-only mode.
     * 
     * You can generate an OAuth token by visiting the [Apps & API](https://cloud.digitalocean.com/account/api/tokens)
     * section of the DigitalOcean control panel for your account.
     * 
     * An OAuth token functions as a complete authentication request. In effect, it
     * acts as a substitute for a username and password pair.
     * 
     * Because of this, it is absolutely **essential** that you keep your OAuth
     * tokens secure. In fact, upon generation, the web interface will only display
     * each token a single time in order to prevent the token from being compromised.
     * 
     * DigitalOcean access tokens begin with an identifiable prefix in order to
     * distinguish them from other similar tokens.
     * 
     * - `dop_v1_` for personal access tokens generated in the control panel
     * - `doo_v1_` for tokens generated by applications using [the OAuth flow](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/oauth-api/)
     * - `dor_v1_` for OAuth refresh tokens
     * 
     * ### How to Authenticate with OAuth
     * 
     * In order to make an authenticated request, include a bearer-type
     * `Authorization` header containing your OAuth token. All requests must be
     * made over HTTPS.
     * 
     * ### Authenticate with a Bearer Authorization Header
     * 
     * ```
     * curl -X $HTTP_METHOD -H "Authorization: Bearer $DIGITALOCEAN_TOKEN" "https://api.digitalocean.com/v2/$OBJECT"
     * ```
     *
