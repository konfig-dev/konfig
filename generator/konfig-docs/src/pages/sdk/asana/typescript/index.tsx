        "description": "Sadly, sometimes requests to the API are not successful. Failures can\noccur for a wide range of reasons. In all cases, the API should return\nan HTTP Status Code that indicates the nature of the failure,\nwith a response body in JSON format containing additional information.\n\n\nIn the event of a server error the response body will contain an error\nphrase. These phrases are automatically generated using the\n[node-asana-phrase\nlibrary](https://github.com/Asana/node-asana-phrase) and can be used by\nAsana support to quickly look up the incident that caused the server\nerror."
