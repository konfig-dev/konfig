# Welcome!

This is an interactive demo of Konfig.

### How to use this demo

1. Initializing our SDK Repo
2. Generating the SDK
3. Replacing an existing implementation with the generated SDK

For some context, you are seeing an in-browser IDE that automatically installs
the [Konfig CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/konfig-cli) tool.

At the top of the IDE you will see a file editor that will be used to test the SDK.

And at the bottom of the IDE you will see a terminal where you will run commands.
