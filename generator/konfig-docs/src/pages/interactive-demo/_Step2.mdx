### How Konfig works

At a high level, Konfig converts your OpenAPI Specification or Postman
Collection into SDKs for your API.

To control how the SDKs are generated, we created a type of file called
`konfig.yaml`. This file specifies things such as target languages or SDK
versions.

To generate SDKs, we created a [CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/konfig-cli)
which has been installed to your development environment.

### Create a `konfig.yaml`

Click the terminal and run the following command.

 ```shell Terminal
 konfig init
 ```


You will be prompted to specify what languages to generate SDKs in.

For this demo, we will only generate a TypeScript SDK. Type `a` to de-select all
languages. Then use the down arrow and `space` to select `TypeScript`.
