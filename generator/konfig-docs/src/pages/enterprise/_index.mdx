*customized* guides for your API
</h1>

Konfig learns from your technical documentation and fetches your customer's configurations to generate *customized* onboarding guides. With Konfig, you can run an efficient onboarding process by spending less time handholding customers.

How Konfig Works
</h2>

For example, lets walkthrough the following scenario:

- You have a customer that wants to integrate with your KYC (Know Your Customer) Identity Verification API
- Your customer has a custom verification workflow that is setup elsewhere

### 1. üõ†Ô∏è Configure Konfig

Konfig can be configured to understand your technical resources and your customer's configuration.

    `}
/>

### 2. üìÑ Generate Custom Guides

When the customer is ready to onboard, easily generate custom guides on the fly
that are tailored to your customer's needs.

Here is an example generated guide:

<div className="max-w-[90vw] block mb-[calc(0.15_*_100%_*_-1)]">
<div className="scale-[85%] h-[700px] shadow-xl overflow-scroll origin-top ring-1 ring-slate-800 p-4 md:p-8">

## KYC API Integration Onboarding Guide for Customer

Welcome to ACME! This guide is intended to assist your integration of our KYC
solutions using our API. This document will guide you through setting up your
environment, authenticating requests, and making API calls with custom
configurations.

### Required Parameters Based on Your Configuration

Based on the configuration we pulled from your account, the following parameters are required to initialize the KYC process:

- `address`: The address of the customer.
- `gender`: The gender of the customer.

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have:
- Python installed on your system.
- The `requests` library installed in Python (Install using `pip install requests`).

### Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, ensure the following API key is set in your environment:

<details summary="üîë API Key!">
<div>
```bash
export ACME_API_KEY=9415170c-e774-43aa-b863-3d0a94ef085f
```
</div>
</details>


<Admonition type="caution">
Do not share your API key with anyone.
</Admonition>

### Integrating with ACME

Below are the primary endpoints you need to interact with the KYC system:

#### Initialize KYC Process

This endpoint initializes the KYC process for a customer.

- **Endpoint:** `/initialize`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Required Parameters:**
  - `workflow_id`: The unique identifier of the workflow from ACME
  - `customer_id`: The unique identifier of the customer from your system
  - `address`: The address of the customer
  - `gender`: The gender of the customer

<Admonition type="note">
We pulled `workflow_id` from your account. The `customer_id`, `address`, and
`gender` should be dynamically fetched from your system.
</Admonition>

Here is a Python example that includes the required parameters:

```python
import os
import requests

WORKFLOW_ID = "de65fa5a-130d-43dd-a2c8-d01ff28443e4"
ACME_API_KEY = os.getenv("ACME_API_KEY")

url = 'https://api.acme-kyc.com/v1/initialize'
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {ACME_API_KEY}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
payload = {
    'workflow_id': WORKFLOW_ID,
    'customer_id': 'YOUR_CUSTOMERS_UNIQUE_ID',
    'data': {
        'gender': 'male',
        'address': '1234 Main St'
    }
}

response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

#### Check KYC Status

Use this endpoint to check the KYC status of a customer.

- **Endpoint:** `/status`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Required Parameters:**
  - `customer_id`: The unique identifier of the customer from your system

```python
import os
import requests

ACME_API_KEY = os.getenv("ACME_API_KEY")

url = 'https://api.acme-kyc.com/v1/status'
params = {
    'customer_id': 'YOUR_CUSTOMERS_UNIQUE_ID'
}
headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {ACME_API_KEY}'
}

response = requests.get(url, params=params, headers=headers)
print(response.json())
```

<h2 className="font-extrabold underline">
More than a chatbot
</h2>

To generate customized guides for your customers, Konfig is specifically
tailored to understands the way your system works and your customer's needs.

### üîó Fetches Customer Configurations

Chatbots need to be prompted to understand what to generate. Konfig is
configured to understand your customer's needs without any work from your side.

<div className="border p-2 md:p-4 max-w-fit mx-auto">
#### Required API Parameters

- `name_first`:
- `name_middle`:
- `name_last`:
- `address`: ‚úÖ
- `gender`: ‚úÖ
- `email_address`:

</div>

### üß† Deeply Understands OpenAPI Specification

OpenAPI Specifications are large and complicated. Konfig has a built-in OpenAPI
Specification Understanding Engine that allows Konfig to understand your API
without any work from your side.

  style Konfig fill:#0351b3,stroke:#0351b3,color:#fff,stroke-width:2,stroke-opacity:0.3
`}/>

### ‚úÖ Produces *Accurate* Guides

Chatbots fail to understand the nuances of how your customer needs to integrate
with your API. Konfig *infers these nuances* from hand-written documentation and
generates the necessary guidance based on your customer's configurations.

To solve this, we developed an AI-powered rule and nuance understanding engine
to ensure accurate guidance.

- ü§ù Understands and enforces required API parameters with 100% accuracy
- üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è No hallucinations
